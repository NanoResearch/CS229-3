string(237) "LONDON &mdash; Britain broke out of its double-dip recession in the third quarter with its &nbsp;strongest three-month period of economic growth since before the 2008 &nbsp;global financial crisis, the government &nbsp;reported Thursday."
string(4571) "Although still relatively weak by historical standards, and buoyed by business and consumer activity related to &nbsp;the Olympic and Paralympic Games &nbsp;this summer in London, the economic &nbsp;data indicate that Britain and its own &nbsp;currency are faring better than the euro &nbsp;zone countries in Europe, whose economies are either flat or in recession. The &nbsp;most recent data for Germany, for instance, showed growth of only 0.3 percent in the second quarter.         The widening growth gap between &nbsp;Britain and countries in the euro currency union is likely to bolster the increasingly powerful camp within the &nbsp;Conservative Party of Prime Minister &nbsp;David Cameron that is pushing the government to reduce its participation in &nbsp;the European Union.&nbsp;         Taken with the fact that British interest rates remain among the lowest in &nbsp;Europe, the positive growth figure &nbsp;could provide at least limited ammunition against criticism that the government&rsquo;s austerity program has thwarted &nbsp;a recovery. The Cameron government is &nbsp;likely to argue that it would be a mistake &nbsp;to ease up on its budget cuts now, given &nbsp;signs that economic recovery may be &nbsp;imminent.         Chancellor of the Exchequer George &nbsp;Osborne, architect of the austerity program, hailed the growth figure, contending that the economy was &ldquo;now on &nbsp;the right track.&rdquo; The weak performance &nbsp;of the euro zone, he added, is &ldquo;a reminder that we still face many economic &nbsp;challenges at home and abroad.&rdquo;         The British economy grew by 1 percent in the July-September period, the &nbsp;best quarterly result since the third &nbsp;quarter of 2007, before the onset of the financial crisis here. Although continued &nbsp;growth is not certain, the International &nbsp;Monetary Fund has predicted 1.1 percent growth for Britain next year, compared with a growth forecast of only 0.2 &nbsp;percent for the euro zone.         The third-quarter figure far outpaced &nbsp;estimates by economists and comes at a &nbsp;convenient time for the Cameron government, which has been under relentless political pressure to relax its core &nbsp;policy of reducing the deficit through &nbsp;spending cuts and tax increases.&nbsp;         The British economy had shrunk for &nbsp;five consecutive quarters starting in the &nbsp;second quarter of 2008, righted itself, &nbsp;then sputtered along for a time before &nbsp;returning to recession in the last &nbsp;quarter of 2011.&nbsp;         Critics point out that the third &nbsp;quarter&rsquo;s 1 percent growth was nothing &nbsp;near the 2 percent-plus growth that &nbsp;Britain has reported during past recoveries, and they argue that the government should take advantage of these &nbsp;low rates to spend more and cut less to &nbsp;in order to produce a more robust economic turnaround.         &ldquo;The return to growth is welcome &nbsp;news for the U.K. economy but unfortunately does not change the big picture &nbsp;that the recovery has been exceptionally weak,&rdquo; Charles Davis, an economist &nbsp;at the Center for Economic and Business Research in London, said in a research note.         Other key economic drivers, like construction spending and bank lending, remain in the doldrums, keeping this recovery considerably below previous ones.         Ed Balls, economic spokesman for the &nbsp;opposition Labour Party, said the result &nbsp;was given a lift by one-time factors like &nbsp;the Olympic Games. He described the &nbsp;economy&rsquo;s overall performance as &nbsp;&ldquo;weak.&rdquo; Labour, which is currently &nbsp;more favored than the Conservatives in &nbsp;national polls, has long called for the &nbsp;government to focus less on cutting the &nbsp;deficit and more on investing to spur &nbsp;growth.&nbsp;         But whatever the internal divisions, &nbsp;Britain can contrast itself with the 17 &nbsp;European countries in the euro zone, because it has control of its own monetary &nbsp;policy. During the financial crisis, this &nbsp;has enabled Britain to take extraordinary measures, like the Bank of England&rsquo;s injection of &pound;375 billion, or $600 &nbsp;billion, into the economy through its &nbsp;program of buying government bonds.&nbsp;         Britain has also had the luxury of pursuing a less drastic program of spending cuts compared with many of the &nbsp;hardest-pressed euro zone countries.         1  2 Next Page &#x00bb;	 Landon Thomas Jr. reported from London, and David Jolly from Paris."
