The fat cats, unshackled by Supreme Court and lower court decisions, were not able to buy the presidency or the Senate.True. It also misses the point. About $6 billion was spent on the campaign, and outside groups poured $1.3 billion into political races, according to data from the Federal Election Commission and the Center for Responsive Politics. Supporters of the Citizens United ruling and other campaign-finance cases dismissed the concerns about corruption, contending that more money in elections would increase voter participation and turnout and enhance voters\u2019 knowledge about the candidates and important issues. Actually, even though considerably more money was spent this year than four years ago, turnout in the general election was down a little. Even in some of the most competitive battleground states like Ohio, where both sides poured in cash, turnout decreased. And the higher turnout in some other states was due more to the political infrastructure and ground game than the money the outside groups spent on the airwaves. During the autumn campaign, dozens of voters in those states told me that the carpet bombing of political television commercials caused them to turn off their televisions. The outpouring of money was pronounced in the Republican primaries, and turnout did not soar there, either, even though there was not a real competing Democratic contest. One irony was that the \u201csuper PAC\u201d backing Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, devastated his opponents in the primaries, but in the general election, it was a super PAC backing President Barack Obama, with its early attacks on Mr. Romney\u2019s private-equity background, that was more effective. Did the record amounts of money inform and edify voters? It would be hard to find a serious Republican or Democrat who argues it did. Most insidious is the corrosive corruption of big money. This is a reality that the ruling\u2019s backers in the Supreme Court majority \u2014 none of whom had to run for office \u2014 tried to play down. Do they believe that the Texas billionaire Harold Simmons \u2014 who could gain a lot more money with a favorable Nuclear Regulatory Commission decision permitting his West Texas dump site to accept depleted uranium \u2014 contributed $27 million to Mr. Romney and other Republicans only in the interest of good government? The Republicans\u2019 biggest sugar daddy, the Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, forked over $90 million in this cycle. The Huffington Post reported that Mr. Adelson was in Washington last week to meet Republican members of Congress, possibly to discuss changes to the anti-bribery Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. His company is under investigation by the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission for possible violations of the law by his casinos in Macau. On the Democratic side, there are reports that Mr. Obama\u2019s next ambassador to Britain \u2014 or perhaps France \u2014 will be Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor whose chief qualifications appear to be that she held at least three big fund-raisers for the president and, as a top bundler, raked in more than $2.7 million for his campaign. Correctives to the Citizens United ruling are difficult. The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, is pushing a constitutional amendment to overturn the decision. That is not going to happen: Such an effort has the support of almost no Republicans and requires approval from two-thirds of the Congress and three-fourths of the states. Two House Democrats, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and David E. Price of North Carolina, are pushing a measure that would match small contributions with government money. This solution would be much cheaper for taxpayers than relying on special interests, but it is a tough slog in the current Washington climate. They also are pushing for greater transparency when it comes to the fiction that candidate super PACs are distinct from the candidate\u2019s campaign. And Mr. Van Hollen would end the secret contributions now permissible under Federal Election Commission rules and require complete disclosure. These proposals meet the Supreme Court\u2019s standards. A test of whether the measures go anywhere is whether they can garner some Republican support; advocates are waiting to see whether Senator John McCain of Arizona, a onetime champion of campaign-finance reform, will rekindle his reformer\u2019s zeal. The bankruptcy of the money-driven system was evident in the amount of time the presidential candidates spent fund-raising. In the three weeks after the Republican National Convention, Mr. Romney held 12 rallies, three news conferences and 18 fund-raisers in places like mansions overlooking Biscayne Bay in Florida and a Las Vegas steakhouse where Mr. Adelson had a front-row seat. It was at a fund-raiser, which he thought was private, as most were, that Mr. Romney made his infamous comment about the 47 percent of Americans who \u201cbelieve they are victims,\u201d and \u201cpay no income tax.\u201d Mr. Obama hustled almost as much, taking time away from governing and campaigning. Perhaps spending so much time in such opulent surroundings reinforced the president\u2019s view that the rich can afford to pay higher taxes."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/12\/10\/us\/10iht-educbriefs10.html","body":"Report shows mismatch between jobs and graduatesThe McKinsey Center for Government is scheduled to release its latest report on education and employment in alive Web feed on Monday. The online discussion, which will begin at 9 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, will include panelists from Bogot\u00e1, Dubai, Geneva, New Delhi and Washington. They will address a predicament that involves recent graduates as well as recruiters: 75 million young people are unemployed, and yet many employers say they cannot find skilled workers. According to the report, about half of young graduates are \u201cnot sure that their post-secondary education has improved their chances of finding a job.\u201d On the other hand, 39 percent of employers blamed a shortage of skilled workers for their difficulty in filling entry-level positions. Academic institutions, which are traditionally the link between students and employers, appear to be the most out-of-touch with workplace realities and are overconfident about the skills they provide. According to the report, 72 percent of educational institutions felt that their graduates were ready for the job market, but only 42 percent of employers agreed. QS names M.B.A. programs most valued by employers QS, widely known as one of leading publishers of university rankings, has named the 200 M.B.A. programs that are most valued by employers. Of the 39 \u201cElite Global\u201d institutions selected for the report, which was released last week, 22 were from North America, 14 from Europe and 3 from the Asia-Pacific region. Harvard was the top U.S. choice. Insead, a business school that has campuses in France and Singapore, was top-ranked in both Europe and Asia. London Business School was also among the top three M.B.A. programs chosen by recruiters. Among graduates of those \u201celite\u201d schools, those in Europe earned an average of $109,300 a year, compared with $101,100 in North America. But recruiters felt that U.S. business schools were better at teaching specialized subjects. The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania led in teaching finance; the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Illinois in teaching marketing; and the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management in teaching information management. According to the report, the most academically qualified students are from India. The Indian Institute of Management Bangalore and Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad reported the highest GMAT scores.

But corporate profits are at a record high. How is that possible? It\u2019s simple: profits have surged as a share of national income, while wages and other labor compensation are down. The pie isn\u2019t growing the way it should \u2014 but capital is doing fine by grabbing an ever-larger slice, at labor\u2019s expense.Wait \u2014 are we really back to talking about capital versus labor? Isn\u2019t that an old-fashioned, almost Marxist sort of discussion, out of date in our modern information economy? Well, that\u2019s what many people thought; for the past generation discussions of inequality have focused overwhelmingly not on capital versus labor but on distributional issues between workers, either on the gap between more- and less-educated workers or on the soaring incomes of a handful of superstars in finance and other fields. But that may be yesterday\u2019s story. More specifically, while it\u2019s true that the finance guys are still making out like bandits \u2014 in part because, as we now know, some of them actually are bandits \u2014 the wage gap between workers with a college education and those without, which grew a lot in the 1980s and early 1990s, hasn\u2019t changed much since then. Indeed, recent college graduates had stagnant incomes even before the financial crisis struck. Increasingly, profits have been rising at the expense of workers in general, including workers with the skills that were supposed to lead to success in today\u2019s economy. Why is this happening? As best as I can tell, there are two plausible explanations, both of which could be true to some extent. One is that technology has taken a turn that places labor at a disadvantage; the other is that we\u2019re looking at the effects of a sharp increase in monopoly power. Think of these two stories as emphasizing robots on one side, robber barons on the other. About the robots: there\u2019s no question that in some high-profile industries, technology is displacing workers of all, or almost all, kinds. For example, one of the reasons some high-technology manufacturing has lately been moving back to the United States is that these days the most valuable piece of a computer, the motherboard, is basically made by robots, so cheap Asian labor is no longer a reason to produce them abroad. In a recent book, \u201cRace Against the Machine,\u201d M.I.T.\u2019s Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee argue that similar stories are playing out in many fields, including services like translation and legal research. What\u2019s striking about their examples is that many of the jobs being displaced are high-skill and high-wage; the downside of technology isn\u2019t limited to menial workers. Still, can innovation and progress really hurt large numbers of workers, maybe even workers in general? I often encounter assertions that this can\u2019t happen. But the truth is that it can, and serious economists have been aware of this possibility for almost two centuries. The early-19th-century economist David Ricardo is best known for the theory of comparative advantage, which makes the case for free trade; but the same 1817 book in which he presented that theory also included a chapter on how the new, capital-intensive technologies of the Industrial Revolution could actually make workers worse off, at least for a while \u2014 which modern scholarship suggests may indeed have happened for several decades. What about robber barons? We don\u2019t talk much about monopoly power these days; antitrust enforcement largely collapsed during the Reagan years and has never really recovered. Yet Barry Lynn and Phillip Longman of the New America Foundation argue, persuasively in my view, that increasing business concentration could be an important factor in stagnating demand for labor, as corporations use their growing monopoly power to raise prices without passing the gains on to their employees. I don\u2019t know how much of the devaluation of labor either technology or monopoly explains, in part because there has been so little discussion of what\u2019s going on. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the shift of income from labor to capital has not yet made it into our national discourse. Yet that shift is happening \u2014 and it has major implications. For example, there is a big, lavishly financed push to reduce corporate tax rates; is this really what we want to be doing at a time when profits are surging at workers\u2019 expense? Or what about the push to reduce or eliminate inheritance taxes; if we\u2019re moving back to a world in which financial capital, not skill or education, determines income, do we really want to make it even easier to inherit wealth? As I said, this is a discussion that has barely begun \u2014 but it\u2019s time to get started, before the robots and the robber barons turn our society into something unrecognizable."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/12\/10\/business\/banks-face-a-huge-reckoning-in-the-mortgage-mess.html","body":"The nation\u2019s largest banks are facing a fresh torrent of lawsuits asserting that they sold shoddy mortgage securities that imploded during the financial crisis, potentially adding significantly to the tens of billions of dollars the banks have already paid to settle other cases.Regulators, prosecutors, investors and insurers have filed dozens of new claims against Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and others, related to more than $1 trillion worth of securities backed by residential mortgages. Estimates of potential costs from these cases vary widely, but some in the banking industry fear they could reach $300 billion if the institutions lose all of the litigation. Depending on the final price tag, the costs could lower profits and slow the economic recovery by weakening the banks\u2019 ability to lend just as the housing market is showing signs of life. The banks are battling on three fronts: with prosecutors who accuse them of fraud, with regulators who claim that they duped investors into buying bad mortgage securities, and with investors seeking to force them to buy back the soured loans. \u201cWe are at an all-time high for this mortgage litigation,\u201d said Christopher J. Willis, a lawyer with Ballard Spahr, which handles securities and consumer litigation. Efforts by the banks to limit their losses could depend on the outcome of one of the highest-stakes lawsuits to date \u2014 the $200 billion case that the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the housing twins Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, filed against 17 banks last year, claiming that they duped the mortgage finance giants into buying shaky securities. Last month, lawyers for some of the nation\u2019s largest banks descended on a federal appeals court in Manhattan to make their case that the agency had waited too long to sue. A favorable ruling could overturn a decision by Judge Denise L. Cote, who is presiding over the litigation and has so far rejected virtually every defense raised by the banks, and would be cheered in bank boardrooms. It could also allow the banks to avoid federal housing regulators\u2019 claims. At the same time, though, some major banks are hoping to reach a broad settlement with housing agency officials, according to several people with knowledge of the talks. Although the negotiations are at a very tentative stage, the banks are broaching a potential cease-fire. As the housing market and the nation\u2019s economy slowly recover from the 2008 financial crisis, Wall Street is vulnerable on several fronts, including tighter regulations assembled in the aftermath of the crisis and continuing investigations into possible rigging of a major international interest rate. But the mortgage lawsuits could be the most devastating and expensive threat, bank analysts say. \u201cAll of Wall Street has essentially refused to deal with the real costs of the litigation that they are up against,\u201d said Christopher Whalen, a senior managing director at Tangent Capital Partners. \u201cThe real price tag is terrifying.\u201d Anticipating painful costs from mortgage litigation, the five major sellers of mortgage-backed securities set aside $22.5 billion as of June 30 just to cushion themselves against demands that they repurchase soured loans from trusts, according to an analysis by Natoma Partners. But in the most extreme situation, the litigation could empty even more well-stocked reserves and weigh down profits as the banks are forced to pay penance for the subprime housing crisis, according to several senior officials in the industry. There is no industrywide tally of how much banks have paid since the financial crisis to put the mortgage litigation behind them, but analysts say that future settlements will dwarf the payouts so far. That is because banks, for the most part, have settled only a small fraction of the lawsuits against them. JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse, for example, agreed last month to settle mortgage securities cases with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $417 million, but still face billions of dollars in outstanding claims. Bank of America is in the most precarious position, analysts say, in part because of its acquisition of the troubled subprime lender Countrywide Financial. Last year, Bank of America paid $2.5 billion to repurchase troubled mortgages from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and $1.6 billion to Assured Guaranty, which insured the shaky mortgage bonds. But in October, federal prosecutors in New York accused the bank of perpetrating a fraud through Countrywide by churning out loans at such a fast pace that controls were largely ignored. A settlement in that case could reach well beyond $1 billion because the Justice Department sued the bank under a law that could allow roughly triple the damages incurred by taxpayers. Bank of America\u2019s attempts to resolve some mortgage litigation with an umbrella settlement have stalled. In June 2011, the bank agreed to pay $8.5 billion to appease investors, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Pimco, that lost billions of dollars when the mortgage securities assembled by the bank went bad. But the settlement is in limbo after being challenged by investors. Kathy D. Patrick, the lawyer representing investors, has said she will set her sights on Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo next. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/12\/10\/business\/economy\/fed-likely-to-sustain-bond-buying-program-to-stimulate-growth.html","body":"WASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce on Wednesday that it will continue buying Treasury securities to stimulate growth in the new year. The Fed\u2019s public declaration in September that it would buy bonds until the outlook for the labor market \u201cimproved substantially\u201d has cleared away much of the uncertainty and controversy that usually precedes such announcements. The economic recovery remains lackluster and millions are looking for work. But while some analysts question the central bank\u2019s ability to improve the situation, few doubt that the Fed, under its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, is determined to keep trying. Indeed, while Fed officials continue to warn that a failure to avert scheduled tax increases and spending cuts next year would overwhelm their efforts and plunge the economy back into recession, they have also said that even if Congress and the White House negotiate a compromise, the Fed\u2019s efforts would continue. \u201cI am not prepared to say we are remotely close to substantial improvement on the employment front,\u201d Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in a recent speech. \u201cI expect that continued aggressive use of balance sheet monetary tools will be appropriate and justified by economic conditions for some time, even if fiscal cliff issues are properly addressed.\u201d The remarks were particularly significant because Mr. Lockhart is among the moderate members of the Federal Open Market Committee whose support Mr. Bernanke invested months in winning before starting the new policy. With the direction of policy clearly set, debate has turned to the details. The Fed, whose policy-making committee is meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, still must determine what to buy and how much to spend, and officials continue to debate the best way to describe when the agency is likely to stop buying. In making those decisions, the Fed must balance its conviction that buying bonds reduces borrowing costs for businesses and consumers against concerns the purchases might disrupt financial markets or inhibit its control of inflation. Analysts say the immediate answer is likely to be more of the same. The Fed currently buys $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities and $45 billion of Treasury securities a month. Officials highlighted that $85 billion figure in September, and have indicated since that it remained their rough target. \u201cIt would be odd for them to disappoint the expectations that they have created themselves,\u201d Kris Dawsey of Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients predicting that the Fed would maintain both the dollar amount and the division. Other analysts have suggested the Fed might slightly decrease the total amount of purchases, to $80 billion, or increase the share of mortgage securities. The Fed is unlikely to announce a new timetable this week, analysts said. The committee has said that it does not plan to raise interest rates before the middle of 2015, and that it will stop buying bonds before it starts raising rates. Many officials on the 12-member committee \u2014 perhaps even the majority \u2014 would prefer to substitute economic objectives for guidance set by the calendar. The Fed\u2019s ability to reduce borrowing costs derives in part from persuading investors that interest rates will remain low. Telling investors how the economic situation must change in order to warrant a change in policy could be more convincing, and therefore more potent, than simply publishing an estimated endpoint, these officials say. But an account of the committee\u2019s previous meeting, in late October, showed that officials remained divided about which economic objectives to use. The most vocal proponent of focusing on economic goals, Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said last month that the Fed should declare its intent to keep short-term interest rates near zero until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent, provided that the rate of inflation did not exceed 2.5 percent. \u201cI believe we have the ability to go even further in reassuring financial markets and the general public that policy will stay appropriately accommodative,\u201d Mr. Evans said in advocating the change during a speech in Toronto. Other officials have misgivings about placing such emphasis on any single economic indicator, or on the unemployment rate in particular. The discussions are moving slowly, in part because it is not clear the changes being contemplated would have significant benefits. The targets the Fed is considering closely resemble its own past practice, meaning the new thresholds would tend to reinforce rather than shift expectations. Lou Crandall, chief economist at the research firm Wrightson ICAP, noted in a recent analysis that the unemployment rate exceeded 7 percent in the mid-1980s and again in the early 1990s, and in both cases the Fed waited until the rate fell well into the 6 percent range before it began to raise interest rates. The relative complacency of Fed officials also reflects their judgment that the mortgage-bond purchases announced in September are working. Average interest rates on 30-year mortgages are at the lowest levels on record, averaging 3.35 percent in November, according to Freddie Mac\u2019s regular survey. \u201cThis is solid evidence that our policy has been and continues to be effective \u2014 though it is certainly not all-powerful in current circumstances,\u201d William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said last week. To continue the companion purchases of Treasury securities, the Fed will need to change its approach. It is now buying long-term securities with proceeds from the sale of short-term securities, but it is running out of inventory to sell. The most likely alternative is to create money by crediting the accounts of banks that sell bonds to the Fed, the same method now being used to buy mortgage bonds and also to finance earlier rounds of the Fed\u2019s so-called quantitative easing. The Fed has repeatedly overestimated the health of the economy and the impact of its efforts. This time, officials have promised to maintain their efforts even as the economy shows signs of improvement. But they are once again sounding notes of cautious optimism about the coming year \u2014 if Washington does not interfere. A budget deal reducing deficits in the long term, Mr. Bernanke said in November, \u201ccould help make the new year a very good one for the American economy.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/12\/10\/business\/economy\/economic-reports-for-the-week-of-dec-10.html","body":"ECONOMIC REPORTS Data scheduled to be released include the trade deficit for October and wholesale trade for October (Monday); import prices for November (Wednesday); weekly jobless claims, retail sales for November, the Producer Price Index for November and business inventories for October (Thursday); and the Consumer Price Index for November and industrial production for November (Friday).

Now, looking for more value on the remaining dollars, Governor Scott and Republican lawmakers are prodding Florida\u2019s 12 state universities to find ways to steer students toward majors that are in demand in the job market. The message from Tallahassee could not be blunter: Give us engineers, scientists, health care specialists and technology experts. Do not worry so much about historians, philosophers, anthropologists and English majors. To nudge students toward job-friendly degrees, the governor\u2019s task force on higher education suggested recently that university tuition rates be frozen for three years for majors in \u201cstrategic areas,\u201d which would vary depending on supply and demand. An undergraduate student would pay less for a degree in engineering or biotechnology \u2014 whose classes are among the most expensive for universities \u2014 than for a degree in history or psychology. State financing, which has dropped drastically in the past five years, would be expected to make up the tuition gap. At the same time, Mr. Scott wants the state\u2019s 28 colleges (formerly called community colleges) to offer some of their four-year degrees for $10,000. That amount is $3,000 or so less than the typical cost. So far, several colleges are planning to take him up on the challenge, which would attract new students and encourage people to complete their degrees. The idea for a $10,000-degree originated last year with Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. In Florida, the challenge has been lauded by business groups. \u201cEvery business has to figure out how to make itself more efficient,\u201d Mr. Scott said when announcing the challenge at St. Petersburg College last month. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to use technology. They\u2019ve got to use the Internet, things like that. We can do the same thing with our state colleges.\u201d Universities cannot offer four-year degrees for $10,000 \u2014 their average is more than $24,000 \u2014 but they are being asked to spend their money more judiciously. They are also being asked to quantify their performances by, for example, figuring out which of their students actually get jobs after graduation. Dale A. Brill, the chairman of the governor\u2019s task force and a \u201cliberal arts guy,\u201d said universities needed to be realistic. Generous state financing is no longer an option, at least not in Florida. Universities, he said, need to be practical about the value of their degrees at a time when well-paying jobs are scarce, a position taken by a growing number of institutions and one that underscores the latest philosophical divide over education. \u201cThe higher education system needs to evolve with the economy,\u201d said Mr. Brill, the president of the Florida Chamber Foundation. \u201cPeople pay taxes expecting that the public good will be served to the greatest degree possible. We call that a return on investment.\u201d Florida\u2019s new Senate president, Don Gaetz, a Republican, agrees. He has said he wants \u201cto lash higher education to the realities and opportunities of the economy.\u201d But the shift toward market-based degrees and greater affordability after five years of budget cuts has its detractors. In a letter to the governor, Roberto Martinez, the vice chairman of the State Board of Education, which oversees state colleges, called it a \u201cvery bad idea.\u201d \u201cThe \u2018$10,000 Bachelor\u2019s Degree\u2019 is not a serious policy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt will be perceived as a gimmick pretending to be a policy used as a sound bite.\u201d At the University of Florida, the state\u2019s most prestigious campus, a group of history professors criticized the recommendation for tiered tuition and organized a protest petition. Liberal arts devotees across the state are signing it. The professors said the move would inevitably reduce the number of students who take humanities classes, which would further diminish financing for those departments. In the end, Florida universities with nationally prominent programs, like the one for Latin American history at the University of Florida, will lose coveted professors and their overall luster. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/12\/10\/world\/europe\/social-democrats-formally-nominate-merkel-rival.html","body":"BERLIN \u2014 As if it weren\u2019t challenging enough to run against a chancellor viewed as Europe\u2019s most powerful leader, Angela Merkel\u2019s main rival in next year\u2019s national election has come under fire since his nomination for the nearly $1.7 million he earned from speaking fees in the past three years.But Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, who was formally nominated by the Social Democratic Party on Sunday to run for chancellor, demonstrated in a wide-ranging speech to party delegates that he was unwilling to let either hurdle hamper his campaign. He characterized Ms. Merkel as a dividing force who has isolated Germany from its European partners and whose policies have widened the rift between rich and poor. Mr. Steinbr\u00fcck is a 65-year-old economics expert who served as finance minister in Ms. Merkel\u2019s first government, in coalition with the Social Democrats from 2005 to 2009, and he rejected another such tie-up of the country\u2019s two main political parties. \u201cI am not available for a grand coalition,\u201d Mr. Steinbr\u00fcck said. \u201cI want Germany to find a new, social equality. I want change instead of stagnation.\u201d His biting humor and sharp wit were on display at a convention convened for the purpose of formally electing him as the party\u2019s candidate. But he also displayed a humble, more personal side, acknowledging the loss of support because of the scandal surrounding his private earnings. \u201cI thank you for bearing this burden for me and with me,\u201d he told the more than 580 delegates. \u201cI have not only had criticism from your ranks, but much solidarity \u2014 more than I ever thought I could expect.\u201d Long considered unpopular among Social Democratic women and the party\u2019s more traditional, working-class left wing, Mr. Steinbr\u00fcck reached out to them, emphasizing fair pay, social equality, education and increased regulation of financial markets as central issues for his campaign. It appeared to pay off, with more than 93 percent voting in his favor. \u201cEconomic policy is only good as long as it helps people,\u201d Mr. Steinbr\u00fcck said. \u201cThe market has to justify itself before democratic and social life, and not the other way around.\u201d Germany is one of the few European countries not to have had a change of government since the start of the sovereign debt crisis in 2008. Most recently, French voters swung to the left, ushering in a Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. Whether Germans are ready to follow suit is unclear. In times of trouble, they have tended to avoid change, and Ms. Merkel is widely seen as having guarded German prosperity in the face of economic turbulence across Europe. A survey published last week showed the chancellor\u2019s ratings suffering a week after news broke that the second round of financial assistance to Greece would cost German taxpayers 700 million euros, or about $905 million. Analysts said they were not sure the Social Democrats\u2019 focus on social justice would be enough to unseat Ms. Merkel. \u201cThey found an issue that they can use to win points against the conservatives,\u201d said Karl-Rudolf Korte, a professor of political science at Duisburg-Essen University. \u201cWhether they can succeed in making it relevant in a year that will be more focused on security than justice will be the big question.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/12\/09\/us\/texas-campaign-contributions-blackout-serves-many-functions.html","body":"Ladies and gentlemen, close your checkbooks. Sunday starts the blackout on campaign contributions to Texas state officeholders, \u00a0 a period of pecuniary protection that will last until after the legislative session that begins in a month.The no-contributions period, which began in 1987, is intended to put a polite distance between the giving of political money and the casting of governmental votes \u2014 to erase the possibility of a Tuesday contribution turning into a Thursday favor or the possibility that an innocent juxtaposition might be seen the wrong way. It has proved remarkably difficult in the past to convince nonparticipants that the money and the voting are unrelated. During a 1989 special legislative session \u2014\u00a0there is no contributions blackout during a special session \u2014 the East Texas poultry tycoon Bo Pilgrim offered checks to nine senators on the Senate floor during a break in the proceedings. He left a blank after \u201cpay to the order of\u201d so the senators could write in the appropriate payee. The name of their political committees, for instance. Or whatever. Ronnie Earle, Travis County\u2019s top prosecutor at the time, told The Associated Press that he could not make a bribery case of Mr. Pilgrim\u2019s donation. \u201cIn Texas, it\u2019s almost impossible to bribe a public official as long as you report it,\u201d Mr. Earle said. The contributions blackout took a lot of excitement out of political finance in Texas, but the money still flows, just at other times and places. The blackout serves as a deadline: lawmakers who wanted to raise money before Father\u2019s Day had to do it by the end of the day Saturday. Lawmakers try to raise money now for a variety of reasons. Their accounts are depleted, relatively speaking, after the elections. Many of them supplement the salaries of some of their state employees out of their political accounts and pay their political staffs to remain in business. Some want to have the money in their accounts to caution potential competitors. Who wants to run against someone who already has enough money to finance a campaign? On the other side, lobbyists, trade groups and other contributors who wanted to show a little love to the Legislature had until that deadline to weigh in. Sites around Austin were bustling with fund-raisers during the last couple of weeks. They want to take care of their political friends. It\u2019s a busy and expensive time for some of them, but it gives everyone a chance to recharge the relationships they rely on between elections. The deadline also serves as the terminus of the political \u201clate train,\u201d the term for contributions given after an election to someone the donor opposed or ignored during the election season. After the election and before the blackout, late donors can get on the late train to reverse their transgressions\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to kiss and make up. The fund-raising flurry also serves as a measure of strength. When there is a serious race for speaker of the House, for instance, it\u2019s a time to spy, to see who is contributing to whom, to see how the interests and the members themselves are lining up. It\u2019s the political version of the rituals that take place before a high school prom, full of pairings, snubs, social moves, gaffes and surprises. In January, the numbers come out. Texas campaign finance laws don\u2019t require final election spending reports from candidates until mid-January; that is also when the candidates will show how much they have raised since Election Day and how much money they have on hand. The reports are public records of political health. Who has the most money going into a legislative session, and how does it compare with what their opponents have? Potential candidates for statewide office in 2014 will be able to see how the competition stacks up, where the money is coming from, who is formidable. The blackout doesn\u2019t apply to everyone \u2014\u00a0just the state officeholders. Anyone who wants to run but who is not in office now has six months to raise money without competition from the incumbents, and they do not have to report the results for their 2013 efforts until mid-July. Another reason for the pre-deadline rush: During the first half of the year, the challengers have the advantage. rramsey@texastribune.org"}][{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/12\/09\/fashion\/extreme-obstacle-course-races-forge-a-bond-in-mud-and-guts.html","body":"BY Monday morning, Michael Cugini would be back at his desk at a major Wall Street firm, another high-powered cog in the engine of finance. There would be men on his left, men on his right, all yelling into their phones and scanning the stock ticker.But Mr. Cugini bore unseen scars beneath his crisp custom suit. Twenty-four hours earlier, Mr. Cugini (nickname Cujo) was shirtless, face down, crawling through a 40-foot-long pit of cold mud, while being electrified by low-hanging wires. He also scaled a 15-foot-high wall, ran 12 miles and underwent something called an Arctic Enema, in which he jumped into a Dumpster filled with ice water, dyed neon green, and swam under concertina wire. Two and a half hours after he began, Mr. Cugini crossed the finish line, bloody but unbowed. He had a Dos Equis to celebrate. \u201cThere\u2019s always a lot of moaning on Monday morning,\u201d said Mr. Cugini, 31, a small man with a bald head and a strong grip. \u201cAnd I just think, \u2018Come on, what did you do this weekend?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Cugini had company. About 25,700 others participated that October weekend in an ordeal in Englishtown, N.J., known as Tough Mudder, an extreme obstacle course that is becoming the macho sport of choice for Type A men (and some women) who find marathons too easy and triathlons meh. Started in 2010 by a Harvard Business School graduate, Tough Mudder has exploded onto the fitness scene, with 35 races this year in 4 countries and 660,000 participants to date. Next year, 55 events are scheduled for 5 countries. Along with other quasi-military obstacle courses like the Spartan Race and Warrior Dash, Tough Mudder is the new gantlet for body-conscious Gen Xers. Though the muddy details vary, each challenge consists of a 3- to 12-mile course spiked with cheekily named obstacles like Ball Shrinker. Rewards vary. There is neither a trophy nor a purse for Tough Mudder, only an orange headband. Spartan Race, on the other hand, gave away $500,000 in purse money this year. Beer is normally included with entrance fees, which range from $80 to $200. The common motivator could be called the Walter Mitty weekend-warrior complex. While the races draw a fair share of endurance athletes and ex-military, many of the muddiest, most avid, most agro participants hail from Wall Street. \u201cGoldman brings a massive team,\u201d said Will Dean, the 31-year-old founder of Tough Mudder. \u201cSo does Morgan Stanley.\u201d That they do makes sense since Mr. Dean tailored his sport for cubicle-bound masses yearning to breathe free. \u201cWhen we started Tough Mudder, we identified a few key demographics,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of them was the white-collar urban professional.\u201d FROM a distance, the Tough Mudder course at the Old Bridge Township Raceway Park looked more like a medieval battlefield than a 400-acre racetrack. Beefy figures, silhouetted against a frigid slate gray sky, faltered up steep hills. In the gravel parking lot, teams of men prepared for battle. Some stretched, others squeezed into compression shirts. One man, placing surgical tape on his chest, said fearfully, \u201cThis is going to be 9\/11 on my nipples.\u201d Held in late October, it was one of the last chances to qualify for the Toughest Mudder, an invitation-only championship race in November, and squads of men from the tristate area made the pilgrimage to Englishtown, a small New Jersey town of aluminum diners and gas stations. The chest thumping began before the first obstacle. Next to a cheesesteak stand, a barbershop was set up to dispense free mohawks. A chin-up bar was erected next to a chalkboard, where the highest scores were posted. Nearby, men warmed up by tossing kegs at a cardboard cutout of Fabio. The bonding intensified at the start line. From 8 a.m. onward, teams gathered in a gated corral on the racetrack, which was still sticky from burned tires, stamping their feet in the cold and jumping up and down in anticipation. Many wore matching T-shirts with team names like Mudlife Crisis and the STDS (short for \u201cSuper Tough Dudes\u201d). One shirt read, \u201cI don\u2019t get drunk, I get awesome.\u201d The fittest tended to go shirtless. With American flags fluttering overhead, a wiry announcer in a plaid cap and tight blue T-shirt lifted the mic. \u201cEverybody take a knee!\u201d he yelled, and everyone knelt. \u201cWe\u2019re going to test your fitness. Oo-rah!\u201d \u201cOo-rah!\u201d the crowd replied, using the traditional greeting of the Marine Corps. As the last note of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d sounded, a monster truck roared to life and the Tough Mudders chased after it, like a herd of lemmings clad in Under Armour. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/12\/09\/us\/politics\/new-taxes-to-take-effect-to-fund-health-care-law.html","body":"WASHINGTON \u2014 For more than a year, politicians have been fighting over whether to raise taxes on high-income people. They rarely mention that affluent Americans will soon be hit with new taxes adopted as part of the 2010 health care law.The new levies, which take effect in January, include an increase in the payroll tax on wages and a tax on investment income, including interest, dividends and capital gains. The Obama administration proposed rules to enforce both last week. Affluent people are much more likely than low-income people to have health insurance, and now they will, in effect, help pay for coverage for many lower-income families. Among the most affluent fifth of households, those affected will see tax increases averaging $6,000 next year, economists estimate. To help finance Medicare, employees and employers each now pay a hospital insurance tax equal to 1.45 percent on all wages. Starting in January, the health care law will require workers to pay an additional tax equal to 0.9 percent of any wages over $200,000 for single taxpayers and $250,000 for married couples filing jointly. The new taxes on wages and investment income are expected to raise $318 billion over 10 years, or about half of all the new revenue collected under the health care law. Ruth M. Wimer, a tax lawyer at McDermott Will & Emery, said the taxes came with \u201ca shockingly inequitable marriage penalty.\u201d If a single man and a single woman each earn $200,000, she said, neither would owe any additional Medicare payroll tax. But, she said, if they are married, they would owe $1,350. The extra tax is 0.9 percent of their earnings over the $250,000 threshold. Since the creation of Social Security in the 1930s, payroll taxes have been levied on the wages of each worker as an individual. The new Medicare payroll is different. It will be imposed on the combined earnings of a married couple. Employers are required to withhold Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes from wages paid to employees. But employers do not necessarily know how much a worker\u2019s spouse earns and may not withhold enough to cover a couple\u2019s Medicare tax liability. Indeed, the new rules say employers may disregard a spouse\u2019s earnings in calculating how much to withhold. Workers may thus owe more than the amounts withheld by their employers and may have to make up the difference when they file tax returns in April 2014. If they expect to owe additional tax, the government says, they should make estimated tax payments, starting in April 2013, or ask their employers to increase the amount withheld from each paycheck. In the Affordable Care Act, the new tax on investment income is called an \u201cunearned income Medicare contribution.\u201d However, the law does not provide for the money to be deposited in a specific trust fund. It is added to the government\u2019s general tax revenues and can be used for education, law enforcement, farm subsidies or other purposes. Donald B. Marron Jr., the director of the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, said the burden of this tax would be borne by the most affluent taxpayers, with about 85 percent of the revenue coming from 1 percent of taxpayers. By contrast, the biggest potential beneficiaries of the law include people with modest incomes who will receive Medicaid coverage or federal subsidies to buy private insurance. Wealthy people and their tax advisers are already looking for ways to minimize the impact of the investment tax \u2014 for example, by selling stocks and bonds this year to avoid the higher tax rates in 2013. The new 3.8 percent tax applies to the net investment income of certain high-income taxpayers, those with modified adjusted gross incomes above $200,000 for single taxpayers and $250,000 for couples filing jointly. David J. Kautter, the director of the Kogod Tax Center at American University, offered this example. In 2013, John earns $160,000, and his wife, Jane, earns $200,000. They have some investments, earn $5,000 in dividends and sell some long-held stock for a gain of $40,000, so their investment income is $45,000. They owe 3.8 percent of that amount, or $1,710, in the new investment tax. And they owe $990 in additional payroll tax. The new tax on unearned income would come on top of other tax increases that might occur automatically next year if President Obama and Congress cannot reach an agreement in talks on the federal deficit and debt. If Congress does nothing, the tax rate on long-term capital gains, now 15 percent, will rise to 20 percent in January. Dividends will be treated as ordinary income and taxed at a maximum rate of 39.6 percent, up from the current 15 percent rate for most dividends. Under another provision of the health care law, consumers may find it more difficult to obtain a tax break for medical expenses. Taxpayers now can take an itemized deduction for unreimbursed medical expenses, to the extent that they exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. The health care law will increase the threshold for most taxpayers to 10 percent next year. The increase is delayed to 2017 for people 65 and older. In addition, workers face a new $2,500 limit on the amount they can contribute to flexible spending accounts used to pay medical expenses. Such accounts can benefit workers by allowing them to pay out-of-pocket expenses with pretax money. Taken together, this provision and the change in the medical expense deduction are expected to raise more than $40 billion of revenue over 10 years."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/12\/09\/us\/politics\/obama-team-outlines-four-corporate-donor-packages-for-inauguration.html","body":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama\u2019s finance team is offering corporations and other institutions that contribute $1 million exclusive access to an array of inaugural festivities, including tickets to a \u201cbenefactors reception,\u201d a children\u2019s concert, a candlelight celebration at the National Building Museum, two reserved parade bleacher seats and four tickets to the president\u2019s official inaugural ball.The offerings are detailed in an online inaugural fund-raising solicitation provided to The New York Times by an Obama fund-raiser. The document describes four packages that Mr. Obama\u2019s finance team can sell, with differing levels of access depending on the level of contribution. Individuals who contribute $250,000 will receive the same package as million-dollar \u201cinstitutional donors,\u201d which could include corporations, philanthropies, foundations and unions. The financing arrangements are a departure from Mr. Obama\u2019s policy in 2009, when he refused corporate donations altogether and capped individual contributions at $50,000. As in 2009, Mr. Obama will not be accepting money from lobbyists or political action committees. While taxpayers pay for inaugural events at the Capitol \u2014 the swearing-in ceremony and inaugural luncheon \u2014 the president must raise money from private donors for everything else, including the inaugural parade, ball and concerts. In 2009, Mr. Obama raised $53 million. The online solicitation, sent to donors by e-mail on Friday, described the different inaugural packages, each named for a president: Washington ($1 million from institutions and $250,000 from individuals); Adams ($500,000 from institutions and $150,000 from individuals); Jefferson ($250,000 from institutions and $75,000 from individuals); and Madison ($100,000 from institutions and $10,000 from individuals). Financing arrangements like these are typical for presidential inaugurals. To help pay for President George W. Bush\u2019s 2005 inaugural, dozens of companies, including Home Depot and Bank of America, contributed $250,000 apiece. But Mr. Obama\u2019s decision has drawn criticism from good-government advocates, who accuse him of abandoning his pledge to keep big money out of politics. John Wonderlich, policy director of the Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for openness in government, wrote on the group\u2019s blog that the decision \u201cprioritizes a lavish celebration over the integrity of the office,\u201d and that Mr. Obama was \u201cturning away from a principled approach to money in politics.\u201d The president\u2019s inaugural planners, however, have defended the decision, saying that museums, philanthropic organizations and service groups, like the Red Cross, all accept corporate money. And with Democratic donors feeling tapped out from an expensive presidential campaign, the planners concluded they needed to expand their fund-raising methods. The 2013 inaugural festivities will be smaller in scope than the huge celebration of 2009, which drew an estimated 1.8 million people to the capital. The inaugural committee has not announced a schedule for the 2013 events, and a committee aide said that no final decision had been made about the number of inaugural balls to be held. However, donors were told on a conference call on Friday that this time there would be only three official inaugural balls that the president and his wife would attend, according to one person who listened. In 2009, they attended 10 of them. And because Jan. 20, the constitutionally mandated date for the presidential swearing-in, falls on a Sunday this year, Mr. Obama will take his oath in private at the White House, and the public swearing-in ceremony and other events will be held on Jan. 21."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/12\/09\/opinion\/sunday\/kristof-profiting-from-a-childs-illiteracy.html","body":"JACKSON, Ky.THIS is what poverty sometimes looks like in America: parents here in Appalachian hill country pulling their children out of literacy classes. Moms and dads fear that if kids learn to read, they are less likely to qualify for a monthly check for having an intellectual disability. Many people in hillside mobile homes here are poor and desperate, and a $698 monthly check per child from the Supplemental Security Income program goes a long way \u2014 and those checks continue until the child turns 18. \u201cThe kids get taken out of the program because the parents are going to lose the check,\u201d said Billie Oaks, who runs a literacy program here in Breathitt County, a poor part of Kentucky. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d This is painful for a liberal to admit, but conservatives have a point when they suggest that America\u2019s safety net can sometimes entangle people in a soul-crushing dependency. Our poverty programs do rescue many people, but other times they backfire. Some young people here don\u2019t join the military (a traditional escape route for poor, rural Americans) because it\u2019s easier to rely on food stamps and disability payments. Antipoverty programs also discourage marriage: In a means-tested program like S.S.I., a woman raising a child may receive a bigger check if she refrains from marrying that hard-working guy she likes. Yet marriage is one of the best forces to blunt poverty. In married couple households only one child in 10 grows up in poverty, while almost half do in single-mother households. Most wrenching of all are the parents who think it\u2019s best if a child stays illiterate, because then the family may be able to claim a disability check each month. \u201cOne of the ways you get on this program is having problems in school,\u201d notes Richard V. Burkhauser, a Cornell University economist who co-wrote a book last year about these disability programs. \u201cIf you do better in school, you threaten the income of the parents. It\u2019s a terrible incentive.\u201d About four decades ago, most of the children S.S.I. covered had severe physical handicaps or mental retardation that made it difficult for parents to hold jobs \u2014 about 1 percent of all poor children. But now 55 percent of the disabilities it covers are fuzzier intellectual disabilities short of mental retardation, where the diagnosis is less clear-cut. More than 1.2 million children across America \u2014 a full 8 percent of all low-income children \u2014 are now enrolled in S.S.I. as disabled, at an annual cost of more than $9 billion. That is a burden on taxpayers, of course, but it can be even worse for children whose families have a huge stake in their failing in school. Those kids may never recover: a 2009 study found that nearly two-thirds of these children make the transition at age 18 into S.S.I. for the adult disabled. They may never hold a job in their entire lives and are condemned to a life of poverty on the dole \u2014 and that\u2019s the outcome of a program intended to fight poverty. THERE\u2019S no doubt that some families with seriously disabled children receive a lifeline from S.S.I. But the bottom line is that we shouldn\u2019t try to fight poverty with a program that sometimes perpetuates it. A local school district official, Melanie Stevens, puts it this way: \u201cThe greatest challenge we face as educators is how to break that dependency on government. In second grade, they have a dream. In seventh grade, they have a plan.\u201d There\u2019s a danger in drawing too firm conclusions about an issue \u2014 fighting poverty \u2014 that is as complex as human beings themselves. I\u2019m no expert on domestic poverty. But for me, a tentative lesson from the field is that while we need safety nets, the focus should be instead on creating opportunity \u2014 and, still more difficult, on creating an environment that leads people to seize opportunities. To see what that might mean, I tagged along with Save the Children, the aid group we tend to think of as active in Sudan or Somalia. It\u2019s also in the opportunity business right here in the United States, in places like the mobile home of Britny Hurley \u2014 and it provides a model of what does work. Ms. Hurley, 19, is amiable and speaks quickly with a strong hill accent, so that at times I had trouble understanding her. Ms. Hurley says that she was raped by a family member when she was 12, and that another family member then introduced her to narcotics. She became an addict, she says, mostly to prescription painkillers that are widely trafficked here. Equipped with a crackling intelligence, Ms. Hurley once aspired to be a doctor. But her addictions and a rebellious nature got her kicked out of high school, and at 16 she became engaged to a boyfriend and soon had his baby. Yet there are ways of breaking this cycle. That\u2019s what Save the Children is doing here, working with children while they\u2019re still malleable, and it\u2019s an approach that should be a centerpiece of America\u2019s antipoverty program. Almost anytime the question is poverty, the answer is children. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb I invite you to comment on this column on my blog, On the Ground.

Wealthy nations put off for a year resolution of the dispute over providing billions of dollars in aid to countries most heavily affected by climate change. Industrial nations have pledged to secure $100 billion a year by 2020 in public and private financing to help poor countries cope with climate change, but have been vague about what they plan to do before then. Only a handful of countries, not including the United States, have made concrete financial pledges for adaptation aid over the next few years. Todd D. Stern, the senior American negotiator, said that the United States would continue to provide substantial climate-related aid to vulnerable countries. But he said he was not in a position, given the budget talks in Washington and the Congressional process, to promise new American financing. The participants noted with \u201cgrave concern\u201d the widening gap between what countries have promised to do to reduce emissions and the growing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. They declared it unlikely that on the current path the world would be able to keep global temperatures from rising more than two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial times, a central goal of the United Nations process. But the group left for future years any plan for addressing the mismatch between goals and reality, merely stating an intention to \u201cidentify and explore in 2013 options for a range of actions to close the pre-2020 ambition gap.\u201d The accomplishments of this year\u2019s meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change were modest, but so were its aims. The meeting, formally known as the 18th Conference of the Parties, or COP 18, was always seen as a transition from the longstanding division of nations into industrialized perpetrators and developing-world victims of dangerous climate change. That division was enshrined in the Kyoto Protocol, which the United States never joined and which assigned pollution reduction targets to advanced nations but none to developing countries, including the world\u2019s current largest greenhouse gas emitter, China. The parties agreed last year in Durban, South Africa, to work toward a new protocol or other legally binding instrument that would require actions of all parties, not just rich nations as under the Kyoto agreement of 1997. The new agreement is to be concluded by 2015 and enter into force in 2020. The Doha meeting did not produce even the barest outline of what that new agreement would look like, leaving those questions for future meetings. The convention addressed the concept of loss and damage, recognizing the increasing frequency of extreme weather events as well as slower-acting threats like drought and sea level rise. The body adopted language urging more financial and technical support for the most vulnerable countries. But it did not create a mechanism to handle such aid, angering some delegates. Kieren Keke, foreign minister of the Pacific nation of Nauru and chairman of the Alliance of Small Island States, called the package adopted Saturday \u201cdeeply deficient.\u201d \u201cThis is not where we wanted to be at the end of the meeting, I assure you,\u201d he told the delegates. \u201cIt certainly isn\u2019t where we need to be in order to prevent islands from going under and other unimaginable impacts. It has become abundantly clear that unless the work is supported by world leaders, particularly those representing the countries most responsible for the crisis, we will continue to fall short year after year.\u201d It has long been evident that the United Nations talks were at best a partial solution to the planetary climate change problem, and at worst an expensive sideshow. The most effective actions to date have been taken at the national, state and local levels, with a number of countries adopting aggressive emissions reductions programs and using cap-and-trade programs or other means to help finance them. While the United States has not adopted a comprehensive approach to climate change, the Obama administration has put in place a significant auto emissions reduction program and a plan to regulate carbon dioxide from new power plants. California has adopted a cap-and-trade system for 2013. Other countries, including South Korea, Australia and most of Europe, started earlier and have gone much further. It is those kinds of efforts that hold the most promise, at least in the short term, for controlling a problem that scientists say is growing worse faster than any of them predicted even a few years ago. \u201cWhat this meeting reinforced is that while this is an important forum, it is not the only one in which progress can and must be made,\u201d said Jennifer Haverkamp, director of the international climate programs at the Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cThe disconnect between the level of ambition the parties are showing here and what needs to happen to avoid dangerous climate change is profound.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/12\/09\/business\/financiers-bet-on-rental-housing.html","body":"DAVID N. MILLER, a master of bailouts, steps to the dais and coolly explains how the financial world went crazy.It is February 2010. The anger behind Occupy Wall Street is building. Flicking through slides, Mr. Miller, a Treasury official working with the department\u2019s $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, lays out what caused the housing bubble: easy credit, shoddy banking, feeble regulation, and on and on. \u201cHistory has demonstrated that the financial system over all \u2014 not every piece of it, but over all \u2014 is a force for good, even if it goes off track from time to time,\u201d Mr. Miller tells a symposium at Columbia University in remarks posted on YouTube. \u201cAs we\u2019ve experienced, sometimes this system breaks down.\u201d But, it turns out, sometimes when the system breaks down, there is money to be made. Mr. Miller, who arrived at the Treasury after working at Goldman Sachs, described himself as a \u201crecovering banker\u201d in the video. Today, he has slipped back through the revolving door between Washington and Wall Street. This time, he has gone the other way, in a new company, Silver Bay Realty, which is about to go public. He is back in the investment game and out to make money with a play that was at the center of the financial crisis: American housing. As the foreclosure crisis grinds on, knowledgeable, cash-rich investors are doing something that still gives many ordinary Americans pause: they are leaping headlong into the housing market. And not just into tricky mortgage investments, collateralized this or securitized that, but actual houses. A flurry of private-equity giants and hedge funds have spent billions of dollars to buy thousands of foreclosed single-family homes. They are purchasing them on the cheap through bank auctions, multiple listing services, short sales and bulk purchases from local investors in need of cash, with plans to fix up the properties, rent them out and watch their values soar as the industry rebounds. They have raised as much as $8 billion to invest, according to Jade Rahmani, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods. The Blackstone Group, the New York private-equity firm run by Stephen A. Schwarzman, has spent more than $1 billion to buy 6,500 single-family homes so far this year. The Colony Capital Group, headed by the Los Angeles billionaire Thomas J. Barrack Jr., has bought 4,000. Perhaps no investment company is staking more on this strategy, and asking stock-market investors to do the same, than the one Mr. Miller is involved with, Silver Bay Realty Trust of Minnetonka, Minn. Silver Bay is the brainchild of Two Harbors Investment, a publicly traded mortgage real estate investment trust that invests in securities backed by home mortgages. In January, Two Harbors branched out into buying actual homes and placed them in a unit called Silver Bay. It offered few details at the time, leaving analysts guessing about where it was headed. \u201cThey were not very forthcoming,\u201d says Merrill Ross, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities. As of Dec. 4, Two Harbors had acquired 2,200 houses. Ms. Ross says she couldn\u2019t find out how much Two Harbors paid or the rents it was charging. Two Harbors shares, which recently traded at $11.66, are up about 25 percent in 2012. Two Harbors now plans to spin off Silver Bay into a separately traded public REIT. The new company will combine Silver Bay\u2019s portfolio with Provident Real Estate Advisors\u2019 880-property portfolio. Silver Bay will focus on homes in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada, states where prices fell hard when the bottom dropped out. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Silver Bay said it planned to offer 13.25 million shares at an initial price of $18 to $20 a share. But it\u2019s no slam dunk. While home prices nationwide have begun to recover \u2014 they were up 6.3 percent in October, according to a report last week from CoreLogic, a data analysis firm \u2014 prices could fall again if the economy falters anew. Millions of Americans are still struggling to hold onto their homes and avoid foreclosure. \u201cRecent turbulence in U.S. housing and mortgage markets has created a unique opportunity,\u201d Silver Bay said in an S.E.C. filing. The company, which will be the first publicly traded REIT to invest solely in single-family rental homes, says its investment plan will help clear foreclosed homes from the market, spruce up neighborhoods and renovate vacant homes, presumably while enriching its new shareholders. Its portfolio will be managed by Pine River Capital Management, a hedge fund in Minnetonka that has reportedly been buying bonds backed by risky subprime mortgages. Mr. Miller is a managing director at Pine River and chief executive of Silver Bay. Mr. Miller, through a spokesman, declined to comment for this article, citing the pending stock offering. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/12\/09\/business\/chevron-takes-aim-at-an-activist-shareholder.html","body":"PUBLIC corporations routinely tell shareholders that their views matter. The Chevron Corporation, for example, said in its 2012 proxy statement: \u201cYour board welcomes dialogue on the topics presented in the stockholder proposals on the following pages.\u201d So it might seem odd that last month Chevron subpoenaed one of its investors, Trillium Asset Management, which has sponsored numerous shareholder proposals at Chevron over the years. The oil company demanded documents related to those proposals. The subpoena also asked for records of discussions Trillium had about these proposals with the media.It is unusual to make such a demand from a shareholder, corporate governance experts say. While companies often try to keep shareholder resolutions off the ballot by contending that they do not follow the rules, going beyond that is rare. Trillium oversees $1 billion in assets and specializes in what is known as sustainable investing. It focuses on environmental, social and governance factors in its investments and pursues shareholder advocacy programs on these issues. In an interview last week, Jonas Kron, Trillium\u2019s director of shareholder advocacy and corporate engagement, declined to discuss the subpoena. But it is part of a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations lawsuit Chevron has filed against an army of parties involved in bringing an environmental case against the company in Ecuador almost two decades ago. In February 2011, the court in Ecuador ruled against Chevron, awarding the plaintiffs more than $18 billion. The Ecuadorean matter centered on claims that Texaco Petroleum, which Chevron acquired in 2001, had polluted sections of a remote region in the Amazon. Chevron maintained that Texaco successfully remediated the site years before, in a $40 million cleanup. Chevron has not paid the judgment. The company has said it does not believe that the Ecuador judgment is enforceable \u201cin any court that observes the rule of law.\u201d It maintains that the Ecuadorean case was riddled with fraud and says it will \u201ccontinue to pursue relief against Ecuador in our pending arbitration and against the plaintiffs\u2019 representatives in our RICO action pending in New York.\u201d Last July, a federal judge in the United States declined to declare the judgment unenforceable; he did note that aspects of the trial in Ecuador were tainted. And a judge in Argentina froze the assets of a local Chevron unit last month as the court determines whether it should enforce the Ecuadorean judgment. Trillium is not a defendant in Chevron\u2019s RICO suit. But it, along with other shareholders, has questioned how Chevron has handled all this. Earlier this year, for example, 40 Chevron shareholders overseeing $580 billion in total assets signed a letter asking to meet with company management to discuss the matter. Chevron declined. When asked about the company\u2019s subpoena to Trillium, Justin Higgs, a Chevron spokesman, acknowledged that it was not standard operating procedure. But, Mr. Higgs said, it reflects the company\u2019s belief that Trillium was working closely with plaintiffs in the Ecuador case to pressure Chevron into a settlement. That belief, he said, is supported by documents produced in the suit. In an interview on Friday, Randy Mastro, a lawyer at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher who represents Chevron in the case, said: \u201cOur case is about a massive fraud and extortion scheme for billions of dollars. The conspirators enlisted a network of not-for-profits, so-called shareholders who were acting independently but really acting in collusion to get out their false story. We have a right to take discovery of those shareholders and those groups they enlisted to try to find out the methods of the scheme.\u201d Among the concerns Trillium has raised are Chevron\u2019s disclosures to investors about the potential liabilities associated with the judgment. In 2011, the fund manager asked the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s corporate finance unit to review whether Chevron had adequately explained \u201cthe scope and magnitude of financial and operational risk arising from the Ecuador judgment.\u201d In the letter, Trillium noted Chevron\u2019s public contention that the uncertain legal environment in Ecuador meant the company could not estimate \u201ca reasonably possible loss\u201d in the case. But Trillium contrasted this stance with deposition testimony in the RICO case from Rex Mitchell, Chevron\u2019s deputy controller. Mr. Mitchell said the company faced \u201cirreparable damages\u201d if the Ecuador plaintiffs succeeded in enforcing their judgment by seizing Chevron\u2019s assets. It is unclear how the S.E.C. responded to this request. Mr. Higgs, the Chevron spokesman, said all of the company\u2019s disclosures had been appropriate. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/12\/09\/world\/asia\/for-afghan-officials-prospect-of-death-comes-with-territory.html","body":"KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 There are so many ways for an Afghan official to die: car bombs, suicide attacks, a volley of bullets or, in the case of one particularly enterprising assassin, a handgun hidden in the sole of a shoe.On Thursday, a Taliban suicide bomber with a bomb hidden in his groin area tried to assassinate the new chief of Afghanistan\u2019s intelligence service in Kabul, seriously wounding him. Two weeks before, insurgents welcomed two of the country\u2019s newest governors with an armed assault in Helmand Province and a car bomb that leveled an entire city block in Wardak Province. Both governors survived and came away with an attribute essential for politicians here: a sharpened sense of fatalism. \u201cAssassination attempts are a part of the job,\u201d said Abdul Majid Khogyani, the new Wardak governor, seated in a makeshift office in his compound\u2019s frigid courtyard, the only place untouched by the bombing. \u201cIt comes with the package.\u201d He actually grinned. Government officials here do not worry so much about the wrath of constituents; a more immediate fear is coldblooded assassination at the hands of the Taliban. Public service jobs are among the most dangerous in Afghanistan, with hundreds of officials killed every year. The more important the official, the greater the risk \u2014 some particularly fortunate, and well defended, governors have survived more than a dozen assassination attempts. In the last few years, the Taliban have stepped up their campaign against politicians, targeting dozens of provincial and district governors, police chiefs and even marginal officials. It has been an effective tool, demonstrating the insurgents\u2019 power to inflict chaos and sow fear among government supporters. Last year, assassinations claimed 304 lives, the most since 2001, according to a United Nations report. Barring the remote possibility of a peace agreement with the Taliban, the killings are only likely to rise as the American-led military coalition withdraws its combat forces over the next two years. Perhaps the most favored targets are the 34 provincial governors, most of whom are far from the relatively secure enclave of Kabul. Appointed by the president, governors are often the highest-ranking officials most Afghans will ever see. If the persistence of attacks suggests a high-priority target, Gulab Mangal, the former governor of Helmand Province, is a Taliban trophy. Mr. Mangal survived 17 deadly attacks in his five years in office, including a rocket attack on a helicopter, before he was replaced this year by President Hamid Karzai. \u201cEven my friends asked me to quit,\u201d he said, emitting a burst of laughter. \u201cBut I loved my job and slowly, as time went on, I grew fearless.\u201d Not all politicians are so fortunate. Last year, a suicide bomber with explosives in his turban killed the mayor of Kandahar. This spring, the former governor of Uruzgan was fatally gunned down. A man wearing a police uniform with a suicide bomb vest underneath killed Gen. Daoud Daoud, the police commander who oversaw security in nine northern provinces, last year. The year before, insurgents killed the governor of Kunduz Province by bombing the mosque where he prayed. Though some assassinations are carried out for personal reasons, most are political. Despite the risks, governorships have retained their allure. While the position pays an average of only $23,000 a year, the job affords great power, and abundant opportunities for patronage and corruption. And after three decades of war \u2014 with the Soviets, among themselves or against the Taliban \u2014 some Afghans say they have become inured to the threat of death. \u201cThe mind-set we have in Afghanistan is different,\u201d said Farid Mamundzay, a deputy minister at the Independent Directorate of Local Governance. \u201cWe see people dying on a weekly if not daily basis. We\u2019ve gotten used to it.\u201d \u201cIf you die, you die,\u201d he added. Still, politicians take security seriously, spending vast amounts, sometimes from their own pockets, and often taking a direct role in their self-preservation. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb Sangar Rahimi contributed reporting from Kabul, Jawad Sukhanyar from Parwan, and Habib Zohori from Wardak"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/12\/08\/us\/politics\/obama-to-accept-corporate-donations-for-2013-inaugural-events.html","body":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama will accept unlimited donations from corporations \u2014 but no money from lobbyists or political action committees \u2014 to finance his 2013 inaugural festivities, a spokeswoman for his inaugural committee said Friday. The committee also said the activities surrounding Mr. Obama\u2019s inauguration would be smaller in scope than four years ago; the White House is mindful of the state of the economy and does not want a show of opulence. The panel did not release a schedule. But officials told donors during a conference call on Friday afternoon that there would be just three official inaugural balls \u2014 a candlelight ball for members of Mr. Obama\u2019s national finance committee, a military ball and a large presidential ball \u2014 down from 10 official balls in 2009, according to one person who listened to the call. The committee later sent donors a formal invitation detailing access to various reception and parties depending on how much they contribute. The most exclusive access will be reserved for individuals who contribute $250,000 or more and institutions that contribute $1 million or more. The decision to accept corporate money reverses Mr. Obama\u2019s policy from 2009, when he refused corporate donations and capped individual donations at $50,000 per person or $100,000 per couple. Mr. Obama also barred corporations from helping finance this year\u2019s Democratic National Convention. But after the most expensive campaign in presidential history \u2014 Mr. Obama, the Democratic National Committee and the party\u2019s joint fund-raising efforts took in $1.14 billion \u2014 many of the president\u2019s contributors are feeling worn out, and the committee concluded that it would be difficult to raise the tens of millions of dollars it needed for the parade, inaugural balls and other events. \u201cOur goal is to make sure that we will meet the fund-raising requirements for this civic event after the most expensive presidential campaign in history,\u201d the spokeswoman, Addie Whisenant, said in a statement, adding that donors\u2019 names would be posted on a Web site \u201cto ensure continued transparency.\u201d The question of whether the Presidential Inaugural Committee would accept corporate money has been a thorny one for Mr. Obama. Companies that donate money may have business before the White House, raising questions of conflict of interest. Committee officials said its lawyers would vet each donor, and those with conflicts would not be permitted to give. But government watchdog groups sharply criticized the decision and accused Mr. Obama of abandoning his principles. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing,\u201d said Robert Weissman, president of the advocacy group Public Citizen, which wrote to Mr. Obama last month urging him to reject corporate money. \u201cThere\u2019s no corporation which has no conflict of interest. It\u2019s really a terrible reversal of the decision they made in 2009.\u201d Committee officials counter that Mr. Obama is using standards adopted by civic institutions that take corporate money, including museums, philanthropic groups and service organizations like the Red Cross. The committee has laid down some guidelines for the kind of corporate money it will accept, an official said. Corporations that accepted money from the government\u2019s Troubled Asset Relief Program, used to rescue the financial system during the economic meltdown of 2008 and 2009, will not be able to donate unless they have paid back the TARP money. In addition, the committee said it would not enter into any sponsorship arrangements with companies. And in accordance with laws governing contributions to an inaugural committee, the panel will not accept money from foreign individuals or corporations. Presidents rely on a mix of public and private funds to pay for their inaugurations. Taxpayers pay the bill for security and for events at the Capitol \u2014 the swearing in-ceremony and traditional inaugural luncheon \u2014 but private money pays for everything else. In 2009, Mr. Obama raised $53 million for his first inauguration, which stretched over a four-day weekend. Donors are typically rewarded with access to exclusive events; on Friday afternoon\u2019s conference call, they were told that depending on their level of contribution, donors might be invited to \u201cbenefactor brunches\u201d at the White House on Jan. 17 and 18. In 2009, donors who contributed $10,000 or more were rewarded with V.I.P. tickets to the swearing-in ceremony, balls and other events, like a parade-watching party at a restaurant along the route and a concert for children at the Verizon Center. Those who contributed $50,000 or more were invited to events including black-tie dinners the night before the inauguration. Mr. Obama\u2019s 2009 inauguration was a star-studded event that brought 1.8 million people to Washington, more than three times the typical inaugural crowd. Some of the music industry\u2019s biggest celebrities \u2014 Bruce Springsteen, Bono and Beyonc\u00e9 among them \u2014 rocked the National Mall the day before Mr. Obama took his oath. The 2013 crowd is likely to be much smaller, and the committee has not said whether there will be a concert this time. But Mr. Obama has already announced that he will follow a practice he established four years ago by making Jan. 19, the day before his swearing-in, a national day of service."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/12\/08\/nyregion\/quinn-supports-changing-rules-on-campaign-spending.html","body":"Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker and an expected candidate for mayor next year, is supporting a change to New York City\u2019s campaign finance rules that would significantly expand the ability of unions, corporations and advocacy groups to spend money on behalf of local candidates.The bill, to be introduced on Monday, would allow those outside groups to work directly with candidates on their internal political communications with members \u2014 including phone calls and door knocking tours, although not large-scale mailings \u2014 without the costs counting against the candidates\u2019 spending limits. Critics said the measure, introduced nine months ahead of what is expected to be a closely contested mayoral race, would effectively outsmart the city\u2019s stringent campaign finance system, which tries to rein in spending by interest groups and candidates alike. In a strongly worded statement on Friday, the city\u2019s Campaign Finance Board said the legislation \u201cwould open a gaping loophole\u201d in the city\u2019s regulations, \u201ceviscerate\u201d limits on coordinated spending by outside groups and \u201callow unions and corporations to operate above the law.\u201d \u201cA change of this magnitude has never before been proposed this late in the four-year election cycle,\u201d the board said in a memorandum marked \u201cUrgent.\u201d But supporters of the bill, including civil libertarians and some of the state\u2019s biggest grass-roots advocacy groups, said the measure was intended to guarantee the First Amendment rights of unions and other organizations to speak freely about political matters with their members. \u201cMembership communication is a part of what makes democracy work,\u201d said Karen Scharff, executive director of Citizen Action New York, an organization that advocates for public financing of elections and improvements to the state\u2019s campaign finance system, among other issues. \u201cEducation is a very important role of membership organizations and should not be limited,\u201d Ms. Scharff said. Unions and advocacy groups are big political players in New York City, often turning out thousands of members in critical districts to vote on Election Day and supplying candidates with grass-roots support. The proposed legislation, introduced by Councilwoman Rosie Mendez and backed by Ms. Quinn, comes after months of complaints from advocacy groups about a recent opinion by the Campaign Finance Board that classified a broad range of internal political activities by those groups as independent expenditures, subject to significant regulation by the board. Ms. Quinn\u2019s spokesman, Jamie McShane, dismissed the critical memorandum from the board as \u201chyperbolic,\u201d and argued that restrictions on spending by the general electorate would remain unchanged. \u201cThis Council has put in place the most strict spending limits anywhere in America,\u201d he said. City Council aides said that under the proposed legislation, any large-scale mailing of political material to a group\u2019s membership \u2014 one of the more potent ways that unions mobilize support \u2014 would still count against spending limits if coordinated directly with a candidate. But critics of the legislation said it would create a new and weaker definition of \u201ccoordination,\u201d a change that the Campaign Finance Board says would make it virtually impossible to prove that a mailing was illegally coordinated with a candidate. Even before the legislation is formally introduced next week, prominent civic groups were lining up on either side of it. Common Cause and Citizens Action support the proposal; Citizens Union is opposed. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: December 11, 2012An article in some editions on Saturday about legislation backed by Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, that would allow unions and advocacy groups in New York City to spend money on political communications with their members without being subject to certain campaign finance restrictions misstated the position of the New York Civil Liberties Union on the proposal. While the group generally supports the use of legislation to address this issue, the group has not yet taken a position on the specific proposal backed by Ms. Quinn."}]
