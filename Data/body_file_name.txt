[{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/britain-pulls-out-of-recession-in-third-quarter.html","body":"LONDON \u2014 Britain broke out of its double-dip recession in the third quarter with its \u00a0strongest three-month period of economic growth since before the 2008 \u00a0global financial crisis, the government \u00a0reported Thursday.Although still relatively weak by historical standards, and buoyed by business and consumer activity related to \u00a0the Olympic and Paralympic Games \u00a0this summer in London, the economic \u00a0data indicate that Britain and its own \u00a0currency are faring better than the euro \u00a0zone countries in Europe, whose economies are either flat or in recession. The \u00a0most recent data for Germany, for instance, showed growth of only 0.3 percent in the second quarter. The widening growth gap between \u00a0Britain and countries in the euro currency union is likely to bolster the increasingly powerful camp within the \u00a0Conservative Party of Prime Minister \u00a0David Cameron that is pushing the government to reduce its participation in \u00a0the European Union.\u00a0 Taken with the fact that British interest rates remain among the lowest in \u00a0Europe, the positive growth figure \u00a0could provide at least limited ammunition against criticism that the government\u2019s austerity program has thwarted \u00a0a recovery. The Cameron government is \u00a0likely to argue that it would be a mistake \u00a0to ease up on its budget cuts now, given \u00a0signs that economic recovery may be \u00a0imminent. Chancellor of the Exchequer George \u00a0Osborne, architect of the austerity program, hailed the growth figure, contending that the economy was \u201cnow on \u00a0the right track.\u201d The weak performance \u00a0of the euro zone, he added, is \u201ca reminder that we still face many economic \u00a0challenges at home and abroad.\u201d The British economy grew by 1 percent in the July-September period, the \u00a0best quarterly result since the third \u00a0quarter of 2007, before the onset of the financial crisis here. Although continued \u00a0growth is not certain, the International \u00a0Monetary Fund has predicted 1.1 percent growth for Britain next year, compared with a growth forecast of only 0.2 \u00a0percent for the euro zone. The third-quarter figure far outpaced \u00a0estimates by economists and comes at a \u00a0convenient time for the Cameron government, which has been under relentless political pressure to relax its core \u00a0policy of reducing the deficit through \u00a0spending cuts and tax increases.\u00a0 The British economy had shrunk for \u00a0five consecutive quarters starting in the \u00a0second quarter of 2008, righted itself, \u00a0then sputtered along for a time before \u00a0returning to recession in the last \u00a0quarter of 2011.\u00a0 Critics point out that the third \u00a0quarter\u2019s 1 percent growth was nothing \u00a0near the 2 percent-plus growth that \u00a0Britain has reported during past recoveries, and they argue that the government should take advantage of these \u00a0low rates to spend more and cut less to \u00a0in order to produce a more robust economic turnaround. \u201cThe return to growth is welcome \u00a0news for the U.K. economy but unfortunately does not change the big picture \u00a0that the recovery has been exceptionally weak,\u201d Charles Davis, an economist \u00a0at the Center for Economic and Business Research in London, said in a research note. Other key economic drivers, like construction spending and bank lending, remain in the doldrums, keeping this recovery considerably below previous ones. Ed Balls, economic spokesman for the \u00a0opposition Labour Party, said the result \u00a0was given a lift by one-time factors like \u00a0the Olympic Games. He described the \u00a0economy\u2019s overall performance as \u00a0\u201cweak.\u201d Labour, which is currently \u00a0more favored than the Conservatives in \u00a0national polls, has long called for the \u00a0government to focus less on cutting the \u00a0deficit and more on investing to spur \u00a0growth.\u00a0 But whatever the internal divisions, \u00a0Britain can contrast itself with the 17 \u00a0European countries in the euro zone, because it has control of its own monetary \u00a0policy. During the financial crisis, this \u00a0has enabled Britain to take extraordinary measures, like the Bank of England\u2019s injection of \u00a3375 billion, or $600 \u00a0billion, into the economy through its \u00a0program of buying government bonds.\u00a0 Britain has also had the luxury of pursuing a less drastic program of spending cuts compared with many of the \u00a0hardest-pressed euro zone countries. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb Landon Thomas Jr. reported from London, and David Jolly from Paris."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/us\/politics\/for-latina-voters-the-issues-are-personal.html","body":"DENVER \u2014 Fixing the economy ought to be a priority for the nation\u2019s next president: Alejandro Gonzalez and Cynthia Gallegos agree on that much. Yet they speak about the issue in very different ways. He is pragmatic, she is more emotional and personal.And that, experts say, is the challenge campaigns face in appealing to Latinos, whose votes are crucial to President Obama and Mitt Romney. In dozens of interviews \u2014 here and in several suburbs, where the Hispanic population logged some of the steepest increases in the country over the past decade \u2014 Latino men and women spoke of the nuances behind their votes, which could be decisive for the election in Colorado and other swing states. The pocketbook may be driving many decisions this election, but the different ways men and women talk about the issues is forcing campaigns to tailor their messages. Compared with other voters, Latinos tend to live in more traditional family settings, experts say, harking back to eras of the male breadwinner and the female homemaker. Robert R. Preuhs, a political science professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver, called it the \u201ceconomy-versus-family divide.\u201d \u201cMen are expected to be providers from a financial standpoint, while women have a much broader set of responsibilities at home,\u201d he said. \u201cTo them, discussions about health care or education are taken very personally. They\u2019re very much about, how does it affect my children or my elderly parents?\u201d What this has meant for the campaigns is that quite often, conversations with Hispanic women about the candidates\u2019 positions on social issues are held in volunteers\u2019 homes, around a dinner table or at a kitchen counter as a meal cooks on the stove. If the topic veers toward the economy, campaign officials say, the focus is always on the potential impact on the family\u2019s interests, like education or immigration. In appeals to Hispanic men, economic discussions tend to be held in more formal, businesslike settings and generally are focused on the family\u2019s finances. A poll by the Pew Research Center conducted Sept. 7 to Oct. 4 found that most Latino men and women are not so far apart on the issues: They give nearly equal importance to health care, jobs and education, and nearly half say the country is headed in the right direction. Both sexes tend to vote Democratic. Mr. Gonzalez, 79, hewed to that pragmatic view. An Obama volunteer in Aurora, a Denver suburb, he said government must offer the same types of benefits that were available to him \u2014 a Korean War veteran, he became a court reporter and went to law school on the G.I. Bill of Rights \u2014 to foster economic stability. \u201cNobody can do it by themselves,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said. To Latinas, though, who are likely to have more caregiving responsibilities and less income than most other female voters, policy discussions are played closer to the heart. \u201cI am who I am because a public school teacher helped me along the way, because I got grants to go to college,\u201d said Ms. Gallegos, 41, the executive director of Focus Points Family Resource Center, a Latino outreach organization in Denver. A meet-and-greet on a recent Saturday in Ridgway, a rural outpost in southwestern Colorado where 5 percent of the population is Latino, attracted mostly women, many of whom carried their children. Rick Palacio, the chairman of the Colorado Democratic Party, which organized the event, said they were not there \u201cto hear our positions on quote-unquote women\u2019s issues.\u201d They were there, instead, \u201cto hear about stuff that affected the long-term growth and success of their families, whether that be college affordability or the sustainability of Social Security or the survival of health care,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s driving their interest in this election.\u201d Sylvia Manzano, a senior analyst at Latino Decisions, which studies Latino voting trends, said the \u201cpersonal element\u201d gave immigration, particularly efforts to give immigrants smuggled across the border as children a path to legalization, a prominent role in their political discussions, even if it was not their top priority for the next president. \u201cTo them, immigration, health care, jobs, education, they\u2019re all part of the same nexus of ideas that defines the economic viability of their families, or of the people close to them,\u201d Ms. Manzano said. \u201cHispanics know that we\u2019re not the only community of illegal immigrants,\u201d said Pauline Olvera, 46, a member of a grass-roots group called Colorado Hispanic Republicans, a Romney volunteer and a self-described \u201cthird-generation American.\u201d For Maria S. Young, who is from Mexico, it is the tough-on-illegal-immigrants laws of recent years \u2014 in places like Arizona, where 30 percent of residents are Latino, and Alabama, which had the second-highest Latino growth rate in the nation between 2000 and 2010 \u2014 that have driven the partisan wedge. \u201cIt has forced immigrants to pick a side, and it has made it a much easier decision,\u201d said Ms. Young, an Obama supporter who is the president of a company that helps high-skilled immigrants get professional accreditation in the United States. Polly Baca, the first Hispanic woman elected to Colorado\u2019s State Senate, has organized a group called Catholic Women for Obama to drive religious Latinas to base their vote on what she described as the church\u2019s social-justice teachings \u2014 \u201cCompassion,\u201d Ms. Baca said, \u201cfor the poor, for immigrants.\u201d At the same time, the treasurer of the state\u2019s Republican Committee, Christine C. Mastin, whose mother is from Chile, said priests in some heavily Hispanic enclaves have been encouraging congregants to \u201cvote your values,\u201d which she celebrated as a veiled message against the mandate for employers to cover birth control under Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law. Ms. Gallegos said she hoped this would be \u201cthe last election where people are going to try to squeeze us into ideological boxes,\u201d adding, \u201cIt does nothing to give us the type of civic education we need.\u201d She went on, \u201cIt\u2019s about jobs, it\u2019s about schools, it\u2019s about the economy, yes, but in the end, it\u2019s about making life better for all people, including people like me.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/opinion\/krugman-pointing-toward-prosperity.html","body":"Mitt Romney has been barnstorming the country, telling voters that he has a five-point plan to restore prosperity. And some voters, alas, seem to believe what he\u2019s saying. So President Obama has now responded with his own plan, a little blue booklet containing 27 policy proposals. How do these two plans stack up?Well, as I\u2019ve said before, Mr. Romney\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d is a sham. It\u2019s a list of things he claims will happen, with no description of the policies he would follow to make those things happen. \u201cWe will cut the deficit and put America on track to a balanced budget,\u201d he declares, but he refuses to specify which tax loopholes he would close to offset his $5 trillion in tax cuts. Actually, if describing what you want to see happen without providing any specific policies to get us there constitutes a \u201cplan,\u201d I can easily come up with a one-point plan that trumps Mr. Romney any day. Here it is: Every American will have a good job with good wages. Also, a blissfully happy marriage. And a pony. So Mr. Romney is faking it. His real plan seems to be to foster economic recovery through magic, inspiring business confidence through his personal awesomeness. But what about the man he wants to kick out of the White House? Well, Mr. Obama\u2019s booklet comes a lot closer to being an actual plan. Where Mr. Romney says he\u2019ll achieve energy independence, never mind how, Mr. Obama calls for concrete steps like raising fuel efficiency standards. Mr. Romney says, \u201cWe will give our fellow citizens the skills they need,\u201d but says nothing about how he\u2019ll make that happen, pivoting instead to a veiled endorsement of school vouchers; Mr. Obama calls for specific things like a program to recruit math and science teachers and partnerships between businesses and community colleges. So, is Mr. Obama offering an inspiring vision for economic recovery? No, he isn\u2019t. His economic agenda is relatively small-bore \u2014 a bunch of modest if sensible proposals rather than a big push. More important, it\u2019s aimed at the medium term, the economy of 2020, rather than at the clear and pressing problems of the present. Put it this way: If you didn\u2019t know what was actually going on in the U.S. economy, you\u2019d think from reading the Obama plan that America was a place where workers with the right skills were in high demand, so that our big problem was that not enough people have those skills. And five or 10 years from now, America might actually look like that. Right now, however, we\u2019re still living in a depressed economy offering poor prospects for almost everyone, including the highly educated. Indeed, these have been really bad years for recent college graduates, who all too often can\u2019t find anyone willing to make use of their hard-won skills that were expensive to attain. Unemployment and underemployment among recent graduates surged between 2007 and 2010, while far too many highly trained young people found themselves working in low-skill jobs. The job market for skilled workers, like that for Americans in general, is now gradually improving. But it\u2019s still far from normal. The point is that America is still suffering from an overall lack of demand, the result of the severe debt and financial crisis that broke out before Mr. Obama took office. In a better world, the president would be proposing bold short-term moves to move us rapidly back to full employment. But he isn\u2019t. O.K., we all understand why. Voters have been told over and over again that the 2009 stimulus didn\u2019t work (actually it did, but it wasn\u2019t big enough), and a few days before a national election is no time to try to change that big a false belief. So all that the administration feels able to offer are measures that would, one hopes, modestly accelerate the recovery already under way. It\u2019s disappointing, to be sure. But a slow job is better than a snow job. Mr. Obama may not be as bold as we\u2019d like, but he isn\u2019t actively misleading voters the way Mr. Romney is. Furthermore, if we ask what Mr. Romney would probably do in practice, including sharp cuts in programs that aid the less well-off and the imposition of hard-money orthodoxy on the Federal Reserve, it looks like a program that might well derail the recovery and send us back into recession. And you should never forget the broader policy context. Mr. Obama may not have an exciting economic plan, but, if he is re-elected, he will get to implement a health reform that is the biggest improvement in America\u2019s safety net since Medicare. Mr. Romney doesn\u2019t have an economic plan at all, but he is determined not just to repeal Obamacare but to impose savage cuts in Medicaid. So never mind all those bullet points. Think instead about the 45 million Americans who either will or won\u2019t receive essential health care, depending on who wins on Nov. 6."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/us\/spending-on-medicaid-has-slowed-survey-finds.html","body":"The annual growth in spending on Medicaid slowed sharply last year as the economy began to improve, a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found. Enrollment in the program grew only modestly as well, but that may change as millions of people are due to become eligible in 2014 under the new national health care law.Medicaid provides health and long-term care coverage to more than 60 million poor people, at a combined cost to the states and federal government of more than $400 billion a year. During the recession, as Americans lost jobs and health insurance, enrollment in the program rose sharply, and states struggled under the weight of its costs. But in the fiscal year that ended for most states in June, total spending on Medicaid grew by only 2 percent \u2014 much less than the nearly 10 percent increase in 2011 and one of the lowest rates on record. The slowdown is due not only to more measured enrollment growth \u2014 3.2 percent, compared with 4.4 percent in 2011 and 7.2 percent in 2010 \u2014 but also to continued cost-cutting by states. \u201cReining in costs remains the dominant theme,\u201d said Diane Rowland, executive vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan group that conducts the survey annually with Health Management Associates, a research and consulting firm. The most typical Medicaid spending cuts were to reimbursement rates for hospitals and doctors and to optional benefits, like dental, vision and drug coverage. Forty-five states cut or froze reimbursement rates last year, according to the report, while 18 scaled back benefits. Many also expanded the use of managed care for their Medicaid populations. The national health care law has generally prohibited states from tightening eligibility for Medicaid before 2014, when the law envisions expanding the program to cover more low-income people. So the slowing of enrollment is not because fewer people are qualifying, Ms. Rowland said, but because fewer \u201care coming through the door.\u201d Last year was something of an aberration, because states stopped receiving extra federal Medicaid funds that had flowed for nearly three years as part of the federal stimulus act. Without the additional help, the state share of Medicaid spending rose by 27.5 percent last year, according to the survey. That put additional pressure on states to limit costs and helps explain the modest increase in spending. Medicaid has been the subject of heated national debate in recent months, both because the Supreme Court ruled in June that states could opt out of the expansion that is a cornerstone of the health care law and because President Obama and Mitt Romney, his Republican challenger, have sharply different visions for the program\u2019s future. Mr. Romney and Republicans in Congress want to repeal the health care law and replace the current Medicaid program with block grants, giving each state a fixed amount of federal money each year and more control over eligibility and benefits. (The federal government currently sets minimum requirements, like covering all children under the poverty level, and provides unlimited matching funds.) Medicaid spending will grow modestly again this fiscal year, the survey found, with an average increase of 3.8 percent. Enrollment will continue to increase, but by only 2.7 percent, an even slower rate than last year. More than one-third of states say they could see a Medicaid budget shortfall, but that is an improvement over last year, when more than half of states predicted a shortfall. States will also step up attempts to better coordinate care for Medicaid enrollees, especially those with expensive chronic conditions. Thirty states started or expanded such programs last year, the survey found, and 45 are doing so this fiscal year. Many such programs focus on \u201cdual eligibles\u201d \u2014 nine million people who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid, are especially complicated to treat and account for a disproportionate share of spending. \u201cThose changes are an investment up front and require a longer lead time in terms of seeing savings down the road,\u201d Ms. Rowland said."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/us\/politics\/business-leaders-urge-deficit-deal-even-with-more-taxes.html","body":"The partisan rift over taxes has blocked a deficit reduction deal for two years and has spilled into the 2012 campaigns. Yet as Republicans and Democrats continue to brawl, business leaders are increasing pressure on Washington to reach a deal on taxes and spending, even if it raises their own tax bills.On Thursday morning, more than 80 executives of leading American corporations signed a statement calling for a deficit reduction compromise that would \u201cinclude comprehensive and pro-growth tax reform, which broadens the base, lowers rates, raises revenues and reduces the deficit.\u201d Several members of the group, which includes highly paid chief executives of financial and industrial corporations who will stand to pay more if President Obama succeeds in his effort to raise taxes on the wealthy, then helped ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange to draw attention to their coalition, Fix the Debt. The group has raised $37 million for a nationwide education and lobbying effort. Alarmed last year by Washington\u2019s brinkmanship over raising the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, these executives are now mobilizing to avert another such crisis at the turn of the year. After the November elections, they plan to press the two parties to compromise on a long-term substitute for the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d \u2014 the immediate across-the-board spending cuts and tax increases that would affect nearly all Americans on Jan. 1, potentially sending the economy back into recession. The business leaders\u2019 goal contrasts with the campaign messages of both parties. While the executives seem to answer Mr. Obama\u2019s call for \u201ceconomic patriotism\u201d by their tentative embrace of higher personal taxes, in interviews many of them have rejected his \u201cpay your fair share\u201d talk as class warfare, and a good number oppose his re-election. But the business leaders\u2019 position also contradicts the stand of Mitt Romney and other Republicans, who say that all tax increases are \u201cjob killers,\u201d that the federal budget can be balanced with spending cuts alone and that any overhaul of the tax code should be \u201crevenue neutral,\u201d neither raising nor lowering the government\u2019s total tax collection. \u201cTo say that you can solve this without increases in taxes is ludicrous,\u201d said David M. Cote, the chief executive of Honeywell, a Republican and a member of Mr. Obama\u2019s Bowles-Simpson fiscal commission in 2010. \u201cMost wealthy people get it. They just don\u2019t want to be put in the position, though, where you pay more in the taxes and the profligate spending continues.\u201d The Wall Street event on Thursday was just the latest, if the highest profile, of near daily developments in recent weeks in which prominent figures have stepped out of corporate suites to back a deal that would generate more revenue and, by implication, raise taxes on themselves. They support those moves if they are part of a bipartisan compromise that also reduces the long-term costs of entitlement programs, chiefly Medicare and Medicaid, that are the biggest factors driving projections of unsustainable federal debt. Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, who is a Democrat, said, \u201cThe people, including myself, who are willing to give more revenue don\u2019t want to take on the moral hazard\u201d of sending more money to Washington unless the White House and Congress \u201cdeal with the pressing need to cut the budget.\u201d On Monday, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase hosted a Wall Street lunch for about 75 other chief executives to hear from budget experts, including Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a Democrat, and Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican, about what the business leaders could do to promote a bipartisan deal. How, for example, could they persuade Republicans to drop their antitax position? Business leaders \u201cthink it\u2019s just really important that we fix this,\u201d said Mr. Dimon, an early backer of Mr. Obama whose relationship with him later frayed. \u201cThey\u2019re not into whether the tax rate for higher-paid individuals is 35 percent or 39.6 percent.\u201d He was referring first to the top Bush-era tax rate, which high-income taxpayers now pay, and then to the Clinton-era rate, which they face after Dec. 31 if the Bush tax cuts expire as scheduled. Mr. Obama supports ending the cuts for high incomes, and Republicans oppose it. On Tuesday, attendees at the national conference of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association met in New York with Mr. Warner and Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia. The two belong to the Senate\u2019s bipartisan \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d which has struggled for nearly two years to draft a spending and taxes deal. \u201cI\u2019m talking to everybody in this room,\u201d Mr. Chambliss told his audience. \u201cIf you like the package that we ultimately come up with, then we haven\u2019t done our job \u2014 because everybody is going to have to ultimately pay a price in this.\u201d Like others who have privately lobbied lawmakers, Mr. Blankfein and Mr. Cote reject suggestions that the philosophical chasm between the parties is unbridgeable. \u201cThere are very conservative Republicans in the House who sit there and say, \u2018I would agree to a revenue increase if there was significant entitlement reform,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Cote said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ll run into Democrats who say there won\u2019t be any entitlement reform unless there\u2019s revenue increases. For most of us in the business community, we say: \u2018It sounds to us like you\u2019ve got a deal. You just need to sit down and flesh out the details.\u2019\u00a0\u201d That, as members of the Simpson-Bowles commission can attest, is easier said than done. The panel\u2019s dissenters, who opposed the majority\u2019s recommendations of a $4 trillion, 10-year package to reduce annual deficits with a combination of spending cuts and new revenue, included all three House Republicans. Among them was Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman, who is now Mr. Romney\u2019s vice-presidential running mate. The Fix the Debt campaign\u2019s inspiration is the dormant Simpson-Bowles framework, and the group\u2019s formation is due in large measure to nonstop proselytizing of business leaders by the commission\u2019s chairmen, Erskine B. Bowles, a businessman who was a White House chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, and Alan K. Simpson, a former Senate Republican leader from Wyoming. According to the group\u2019s president, Maya MacGuineas, the money raised is financing a growing staff of about 35 at a Washington \u201cwar room,\u201d chapters in up to 35 states and ultimately, perhaps, television ads and other help for politicians \u2014 members of Congress or even the president \u2014 who would need support in taking unpopular positions on tax increases or spending cuts. Mr. Dimon, speaking for JPMorgan Chase, said: \u201cYou know, we\u2019re in 1,900 hamlets in America. I\u2019d \u2014 we\u2019d \u2014 be calling them all up, literally we\u2019d start flying people in. It would be a whole different ballgame, I think, if we had something to support, and with the president supporting it.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/us\/politics\/busy-day-on-campaign-trail-for-obama-and-romney.html","body":"WORTHINGTON, Ohio \u2014 Mitt Romney adopted the mantra that fueled his opponent\u2019s victory four year ago, casting himself as the candidate of \u201cbig change\u201d on Thursday in Ohio as he began to outline a closing argument in the state that could decide the race.On the same day, President Obama wrapped up a sleep-deprived two-day, eight-state jaunt by pressing supporters to exploit early voting in swing states as a bulwark against the possibility of a surge by Mr. Romney, traveling to Illinois to cast his own ballot 12 days before Election Day. It was a day of deeply contrasting messages that hinted at the moods and strategies inside both campaigns: Mr. Romney sought to keep projecting the air of a winner, focused on an ambitious agenda of reform, while Mr. Obama emphasized the gritty mechanics of shoring up his electoral turnout. Mr. Romney, who is essentially deadlocked with Obama in many national polls and has narrowed the president\u2019s advantage in some swing-state polls, started a three-city bus tour here by borrowing a message of change long identified with Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign. The Republican candidate promised to \u201ctackle the problems politicians have spoken about for years but haven\u2019t been willing to deal with.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time for a big change, and Paul Ryan and I represent a big change for America,\u201d Mr. Romney said after rolling into an afternoon rally here. For Mr. Obama, reclaiming the change mantle as an incumbent has been one of his singular challenges. It is hard to run against Washington while traveling with an armed entourage and a big blue and white government plane. So the president has alternated between blaming Republicans in Congress for blocking change and arguing that the change Mr. Romney represents is actually more of the same policies from the Bush era. At an Obama rally in Richmond, Va., on Thursday, Senator Mark R. Warner, a Democrat, summarized the argument in pithy form. \u201cIn 2008, we changed the guard,\u201d he told a crowd of 15,000 who turned out to see the president. \u201cIn 2012, we guard the change.\u201d Mr. Obama made the case, as he does most days, that change has been slower than anyone might wish but that it is under way. \u201cUnemployment is falling,\u201d he said at a morning rally in Tampa, Fla. \u201cManufacturing is coming back. Our assembly lines are humming again.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go, but, Florida, we\u2019ve come too far to turn back now,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to go back to the same policies that got us into the mess. We\u2019ve got to stick with the policies that are getting us out of the mess.\u201d Mr. Romney\u2019s new message of change highlights how significantly his pitch to voters has evolved since he entered the race in 2011. Back then, he devoted most of his time to attacking the president\u2019s economic stewardship, even mocking the idea of big change: a standard line back then criticized Mr. Obama as trying to \u201ctransform America\u201d away from an opportunity society. On Thursday, it was Mr. Romney who called for transformation, of the small-government variety, saying that Mr. Obama stood for \u201cthe status quo path.\u201d \u201cThe path we\u2019re on \u2014 the status quo path \u2014 is a path that doesn\u2019t have an answer about how to get the economy going,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president has the same old answers as in the past: he wants another stimulus, he wants more government workers, and he wants to raise taxes.\u201d Mr. Romney appeared to be testing new language as he prepared for a major speech on the economy, which he is to deliver in Iowa on Friday, seeking to build on the energy he generated from a series of animated debate performances. In a rare moment of political self-analysis, Mr. Romney said that \u201cthe president\u2019s campaign is slipping\u201d and attributed it to the debates. \u201cThey have helped propel my campaign, and they have slowed the president\u2019s,\u201d he said. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb Michael Barbaro reported from Worthington, and Peter Baker from Chicago."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/us\/politics\/climate-change-nearly-absent-in-the-campaign.html","body":"WASHINGTON \u2014 For all their disputes, President Obama and Mitt Romney agree that the world is warming and that humans are at least partly to blame. It remains wholly unclear what either of them plans to do about it.Even after a year of record-smashing temperatures, drought and Arctic ice melt, none of the moderators of the four general-election debates asked about climate change, nor did either of the candidates broach the topic. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney have seemed most intent on trying to outdo each other as lovers of coal, oil and natural gas \u2014 the very fuels most responsible for rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Mr. Obama has supported broad climate change legislation, financed extensive clean energy projects and pushed new regulations to reduce global warming emissions from cars and power plants. But neither he nor Mr. Romney has laid out during the campaign a legislative or regulatory program to address the fundamental questions arising from one of the most vexing economic, environmental, political and humanitarian issues to face the planet. Should the United States cut its greenhouse gas emissions, and, if so, how far and how fast? Should fossil fuels be more heavily taxed? Should any form of clean energy be subsidized, and for how long? Should the United States lead international mitigation efforts? Should the nation pour billions of new dollars into basic energy research? Is the climate system so fraught with uncertainty that the rational response is to do nothing? Many scientists and policy experts say the lack of a serious discussion of climate change in the presidential contest represents a lost opportunity to engage the public and to signal to the rest of the world American intentions for dealing with what is, by definition, a global problem that requires global cooperation. \u201cOn climate change, the political discourse here is massively out of step with the rest of the world, but also with the citizens of this country,\u201d said Andrew Steer, the president of the World Resources Institute and a former special envoy for climate change at the World Bank. \u201cPolls show very clearly that two-thirds of Americans think this is a real problem and needs to be addressed.\u201d Mr. Steer noted that climate change was no longer a partisan issue in Europe and that China, Japan, Australia and South Korea had taken significant steps to reduce emissions and invest heavily in clean energy technology. \u201cThe real question in this country,\u201d said Mr. Steer, a British citizen, \u201cis why politicians don\u2019t see it as in their interest to discuss it.\u201d The list of reasons is long. Any serious effort to address climate change will require a transformation of the nation\u2019s system for producing and consuming energy and will, at least in the medium term, mean higher prices for fuel and electricity. Powerful incumbent industries \u2014 coal, oil, utilities \u2014 are threatened by such changes and have mounted a well-financed long-term campaign to sow doubt about climate change. The Koch brothers and others in the oil industry have underwritten advertising campaigns and grass-roots efforts to support like-minded candidates. And the Republican Party has essentially declared climate change a nonproblem. The two most effective ways of reducing global warming pollution \u2014 taxing it or regulating it \u2014 are politically toxic in a year when economic problems are paramount. After a bill died in the Senate in 2010, Mr. Obama abandoned his support for cap and trade, a market-based method to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and he has given little hint of what regulatory policies he intends to pursue if he wins a second term. Aides said that he would not propose a carbon tax or other energy tax, but that he would consider supporting one as part of a larger budget and spending deal. As governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Romney considered joining a regional cap-and-trade system, then abandoned it because of uncertainty over costs. He has opposed Mr. Obama\u2019s steps to regulate emissions from power plants and vehicles. He has said he would reverse Mr. Obama\u2019s air quality regulations and would renegotiate the auto efficiency standard of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025 that automakers agreed to this year. The struggling economy has made it difficult for emerging clean energy companies to get the capital they need to reach commercial scale and compete with producers of traditional energy sources. Government programs to provide that seed money are highly controversial, as the fight over tax breaks for wind power companies and the recent failures of the solar panel maker Solyndra and the advanced battery manufacturer A123 Systems showed. The Obama administration provided $90 billion in new financing from the 2009 stimulus for clean energy projects, but most of that money is gone. Though there is little doubt that the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation have altered the earth\u2019s climate, some uncertainty remains about whether and when such changes will become unmanageable. Huge technological challenges persist in transforming the energy generation system. Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney refer to \u201cclean coal,\u201d shorthand for capturing the carbon dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants, but the technology is still in its infancy. International efforts to address climate change, which showed great promise when Mr. Obama took office, have sputtered in recent years because of fears that limiting carbon emissions means limiting economic growth. There is also considerable resistance to any plan that would require the United States and other wealthy countries to take stronger measures than those demanded of China, India and other fast-growing economies that are responsible for the bulk of the growth in global emissions. Mr. Romney\u2019s chief domestic policy adviser, Oren Cass, said the nation should not take unilateral steps. \u201cWhat it is going to do is hurt our economy very seriously, and it\u2019s going to drive a lot of industrial activity from the United States to countries that are, frankly, much less efficient in their use of energy,\u201d he said at an energy debate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology this month. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/opinion\/the-sprint-to-election-day-for-romney-and-obama.html","body":"The final weeks of a presidential race are supposed to give the candidates a chance to choose their biggest ideas and strongest pitches to win wavering voters and drive supporters to the polls. So how does Mitt Romney choose to address one of the biggest challenges facing the nation \u2014 its faltering education system?\u201cWe\u2019re going to finally fix our schools,\u201d he said on Wednesday in Reno. And that\u2019s all he said about his education policy. Not even a hint of how he proposes to do that, especially given his hope to make the Department of Education \u201ca heck of a lot smaller.\u201d (He did give the usual verbal shove to teachers\u2019 unions for resisting charter schools, which have hardly proved to be a panacea.) By contrast, President Obama talked about the subject in detail on his whirlwind tour of swing states this week. In Tampa, Richmond and Cleveland on Thursday, he said he wants to recruit 100,000 math and science teachers, train two million workers at community colleges in the skills needed for employment, and pressure colleges to restrain tuition growth. He made it clear that he will spend money on a national priority that Mr. Romney apparently feels can be left to the whims of individual states. That\u2019s only one example of how the campaigns are approaching the finish line, but it illustrates the contrast in their conceptions of what voters want to hear. Mr. Romney is providing nostrums instead of policies. \u201cI\u2019ll balance the budget,\u201d he promised, though his plans to cut taxes and raise military spending would do the opposite. By comparison, Mr. Obama, though he waited too long to begin providing specifics on his second-term agenda, has decided to spend the last two weeks describing them. In his speeches and in a new publication, he is talking about using tax breaks to prod American manufacturing; spending money on repairs of roads, bridges and schools; investing more in renewable energy; and raising taxes on the rich to help pay for all of this. In an interview with The Des Moines Register, he said (after agreeing to go on the record) that he intends to renegotiate the sequester and focus on immigration reform if re-elected. Mr. Romney, who has moved up in the national polls, has apparently decided to play it safe in the final stretch, as wary of explaining how his tax or jobs plans would actually work as he has been through the campaign. The latest swing-state poll numbers suggest that he will have to do better. In the crucial state of Ohio, Mr. Romney hasn\u2019t been ahead in any poll for the last two weeks, and on Wednesday, a Time magazine poll showed Mr. Obama ahead there by five points. For Mr. Romney, Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to bail out the auto industry and his own rejection of it is proving to be an Electoral College challenge. Several states are also feeling the benefits of an improved economy. Obama campaign officials say that to win, Mr. Romney would have to pick off voters already committed to the president in states where Mr. Romney has never been ahead. \u201cWe think we maintain a lot more plausible pathways to 270 than Governor Romney, who we think has to essentially pull an inside straight,\u201d said David Plouffe, the president\u2019s chief strategist. Those pathways exist because millions of voters still harbor doubts about Mitt Romney. He has apparently decided that in the final days of the campaign, he will do little to dispel them."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/opinion\/can-austin-keep-itself-weird.html","body":"AUSTIN, Tex.ON the sun-dappled October weekend when the cyclist Lance Armstrong\u2019s world fell apart, Austin, the city he calls home and that until recently called him hero, went on with the simple pleasures of Longhorn football, live music, festivals and an amateur cyclist ride through the Hill Country. But the midautumn bonhomie couldn\u2019t hide a sudden anxiety around town. Stunned supporters of Mr. Armstrong arrived for his gala benefit defiant in their Livestrong logos, even as The Austin American Statesman sullenly detailed the charges of doping and cover-up, the fleeing of corporate sponsors and the stripping of Mr. Armstrong\u2019s seven Tour de France victories. Among other things, the Armstrong debacle is a cautionary tale for Austin, one of America\u2019s most beloved cities, which I call home. His rise has paralleled the city\u2019s ascent from sleepy state capital to international trendsetter. Each year, millions visit for the city\u2019s music festivals. Its economy has thrived during difficult times. With its success, Austin has attracted celebrity culture, built a sleek city and even attracted a new sport, Grand Prix racing, one usually reserved for the global elite. Yet Austin\u2019s very success, like that of its hometown hero, threatens to overwhelm the simple pleasures and values that make it unique. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint just when Austin entered the American field of vision, but a good guess would be with the release of the first two feature films from the director Richard Linklater, \u201cSlacker\u201d (1991), a day in the life of the city, and \u201cDazed and Confused\u201d (1993), about the last day of class at an Austin high school. Both films showed townsfolk letting their freak flag fly, intent on having a good time, unaware of things like money, status and material possessions. Viewers saw Mr. Linklater\u2019s Austin as another outpost in what the music critic Greil Marcus called the \u201cold, weird America.\u201d Back then, that might have been all anyone outside Texas ever knew about the city. Twenty years later, it is hard to overstate just how popular Austin has become in the American psyche. When I travel and tell people where I\u2019m from, I almost invariably hear that it is either the coolest town they have ever visited or the place they most want to go on their next vacation. It consistently ranks near the top on lists of where to live, whether you\u2019re a college student, recent graduate, single, young family or retiree. With a nearly maniacal devotion to running, cycling, racing and working out, Austin is among America\u2019s most fit cities. It seems to constantly invent more fun things to do. Heck, the Web site Sperling\u2019s Best Places recently named us No. 1 in block parties. Even as the country plunged into recession, Austin continued to create jobs that, in turn, drew Californians by the droves as they fled unemployment and a real estate crash. The local economist Angelos Angelou forecast that the city would see 18,000 new jobs in 2011. He was wrong: the city created 21,000 new jobs. Even layoffs at the computer giant Dell haven\u2019t scratched, let alone dented, the economy here. No one has embodied the rise of Austin better than Lance Armstrong, who went from a local cycling star to an international super-athlete during roughly the same span of years that Austin went from sleepy to sleek and hip. His foundation, Livestrong, turned him into a global celebrity philanthropist. Other celebrities, too, began to call Austin home \u2014 or at least a second home. It isn\u2019t uncommon to dine at Sandra Bullock\u2019s restaurant or spot Dennis Quaid in a bar. Matthew McConaughey is often on the Longhorn sideline. Natalie Portman was at the University of Texas\u2019s recent home game against Baylor. But thanks to all that success, Austin is in danger of losing the simple, quirky vibe that made it special in the first place. Perhaps the harbinger of all this was the death earlier this year of Leslie Cochran, a bearded, 60-year-old man who was usually found at the intersection of Congress Avenue and Sixth Street in high heels and a leopard thong. He ran for mayor three times, usually in a tiara. He was an odd guy, to say the least, and we loved him. Shortly before he died, Leslie warned that Austin risked becoming so big as to be bland. But Leslie\u2019s popularity was less a driving force than a reflection of a culture that blends not just good times but inventiveness and tolerance: \u201cSlacker,\u201d rowdy cowboys named Tant, hipsters in bands like Ringo Deathstarr, frat kids, talented musical artists like Marcia Ball, old money, sunset margaritas on Lake Travis and, yes, the waft of marijuana atop Mount Bonnell each evening. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb Richard Parker\u2019s commentary is syndicated by McClatchy-Tribune."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/fashion\/26iht-acaw-under26.html","body":"NEW YORK \u2014 In Switzerland, a watch brand born of a company best known for manufacturing men\u2019s underwear might be considered to lack gravitas. But the creators of a new timepiece from 2(X)IST, a premium underwear brand based in New York, are not shy about their model\u2019s unorthodox underpinnings.\u201cGoing from underwear to watches is the farthest stretch you can make,\u201d said Morris Chabbott, director of Moret Time, a division of the Moret Group, a 37-year-old giant in the apparel industry that acquired the 2(X)IST label in 1995 and has set its sights on building it into a men\u2019s lifestyle brand. \u201cWe thought, This is how our customers show they\u2019re different than everybody else.\u201d Mr. Chabbott sat in a boardroom at Moret\u2019s headquarters in the fashion district of Manhattan surrounded by male mannequins dressed in the latest 2(X)IST styles: turquoise boxers, striped tank tops, orange briefs. The scene underscored the leap of faith required to produce The NYC, a bold, three-dimensional timepiece that will be rolled out to 2(X)IST outlets this autumn with a retail price of $495. \u201cWe were looking to get into the accessory market,\u201d Mr. Chabbott said: \u201cSo we asked ourselves, What is the most dominant accessory that men wear? A watch. It\u2019s a very big disconnect, but how do we connect it?\u201d In the spring of 2011, the company took its first stab at a collection of watch prototypes \u2014 some 40 styles in all, including one with a dial measuring 46 millimeters, or 1.8 inches across, that looked like an improbable cross between the California surfer watch brand Nixon and the sober elegance of the luxury Italian brand Panerai. \u201cWe looked at it and said, This is not 2(X)IST \u2014 we can\u2019t take it to market,\u201d Mr. Chabbott recalled. Enter Michael Pucci, president of the Abbiamo Group in Burbank, California, a marketing firm with a track record of introducing fine jewelers to fashionable brands. A believer in the marketing potential of men\u2019s fashion watches, Mr. Pucci suggested that Mr. Chabbott team up with Jason Wilbur, an industrial designer whose last timepiece, the Tread 1 for Devon Works, in Los Angeles, earned acclaim for its avant-garde styling and all-American pedigree. \u201cWe clicked right away,\u201d Mr. Chabbott said of his first meeting with Mr. Wilbur in November 2011. The feelings were mutual. \u201cWe had a bunch of New Yorkers about to do what New Yorkers do best: Make a lot of noise,\u201d Mr. Wilbur said from Westchester County, New York, recalling the meeting. \u201cSo I thought, Why not do something inspired by a culture, a people? A watch based on New York City.\u201d Mr. Wilbur\u2019s architectural design for The NYC recalls the scaffolding, bridges and steel-and-glass structures that populate the city\u2019s streets. Fashioned from unusual materials like G10 polymer, anodized aluminum and ceramic, the 46-millimeter watch concedes to watchmaking convention only in the roundness of its dial. Its most striking feature is a skeletonized three-hand quartz movement, supplied by Citizen, sandwiched between two transparent crystals; the hour hand sits below the hour markers, while the minute hand floats above them. \u201cIt\u2019s an honest design because it\u2019s completely open, but it\u2019s also very raw,\u201d Mr. Wilbur said. \u201cIt captures that contrast you experience in New York.\u201d Twelve versions, with pops of color on the hour and minute hands and variations on the silicone strap, are coming to market soon; five will be out this autumn. \u201cAt a time in watchmaking when all you see is the high-end \u2014 because the very rich are still buying \u2014 no one\u2019s investing in this mid-range, nobody\u2019s come out with something that\u2019s unique and interesting,\u201d Mr. Pucci said in August in Las Vegas, where The NYC made its debut at the Project Las Vegas contemporary fashion trade fair. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"}][{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/movies\/movie-listings-for-oct-26-nov-1.html","body":"Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles.

Her timing was dazzling as was her perseverance, as becomes clear in this galvanizing portrait of the artist, his work and his times.

This flick was directed, badly, by Rob Cohen. (Dargis) \u2018All Together\u2019 (No rating, 1:36, in French) This shallow, agreeably chipper French comedy (starring Jane Fonda) about five friends in their 70s who decide to live together steers a careful middle ground between sentimentality and farce. (Stephen Holden) \u2018Arbitrage\u2019 (R, 1:40) Richard Gere plays a New York hedge-fund magnate whose glittering world may be coming undone in Nicholas Jarecki\u2019s sleek entertainment about how very good greed can be. A fairy tale masquerading as a tragedy, the film features Susan Sarandon as the wife and Brit Marling as the doting daughter. (Dargis) \u2605 \u2018Argo\u2019 (R, 2:00) A bearded Ben Affleck directed, and stars in, this smart, jittery thriller about a real if stranger-than-fiction chapter of the Iranian hostage crisis that brought together a smart American intelligence officer, some plucky Canadians and two jaundiced Hollywood veterans (the funny tag team of John Goodman and Alan Arkin) to save the day. (Dargis) \u2605 \u2018The Big Picture\u2019 (No rating, 1:54, in French, Serbian, Montenegrin and English) The adage, \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to be who you might have been,\u201d ascribed to George Eliot, is given a cruel twist in this terrific French thriller. A loose adaptation of Douglas Kennedy\u2019s 1997 novel, it might be described as \u201cThe Talented Mr. Ripley\u201d for the age of Google.

(Dargis) \u2018Detropia\u2019 (No rating, 1:33) A visual caress of postindustrial blight, Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady\u2019s dreamy documentary about a slowly crumbling Detroit places information and analysis distant seconds to mood and impression.

(A. O. Scott) \u2018Here Comes the Boom\u2019 (PG, 1:44) This is a pleasant enough comedy if you can buy the premise that Kevin James would make a credible mixed martial arts fighter. Here he\u2019s a teacher determined to raise money to save the music program, and he takes up the sport for the purses it offers. Mr. James and Henry Winkler, playing a fellow teacher, pair surprisingly well in the predictable tale.

(Dargis) \u2018Hotel Transylvania\u2019 (PG, 1:31) This animated film, essentially \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d with monsters, looks great, though the story grows less interesting as the movie progresses. Dracula keeps his teenage (well, she\u2019s 118) daughter in a hotel that\u2019s exclusively for monsters to protect her from those nasty humans, but she wants to experience the world. A wayward hiker dude only reinforces that determination. Some good monster-related humor early on before the predictable plot takes over.

Would the euro collapse? Would most of southern Europe go broke, unable to borrow money at any reasonable rate? Would that bring on a new world recession? But in this week\u2019s foreign policy debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney, the euro never came up. Europe was mentioned once, but the reference had nothing to do with economics. Mr. Romney did refer to Greece, but only to say we were in danger of going down the same path if we did not change our ways. To a surprising extent, the perception seems to be that the European situation is under control. That is true if all you worry about is whether bondholders will get paid. It is false if you have a broader perspective. The focus of the last couple of years on borrowing costs for peripheral members of the euro zone was, in retrospect, unfortunate. It was always clear that Europe, as a whole, had the ability to solve that issue if it wished to do so. The European Central Bank, like the United States Federal Reserve, has the ability to print money, and that is what it finally did. But the real issue was \u2014 and remains \u2014 whether the peripheral countries could turn into successful economies while staying in the euro zone. On that issue, progress is painfully slow. \u201cThe actions of the E.C.B. and other policy makers in Europe have generally had the effect of filling large financial gaps in periphery bank and sovereign funding,\u201d wrote Bob Prince of Bridgewater Associates this week, \u201cbut have done relatively little to resolve competitive imbalances among these economies.\u201d Banks are hesitant to lend. On Thursday, the European Central Bank report on loan activity in September showed a record 1.4 percent year-over-year decline in loans outstanding to private sector companies and individuals in the euro zone. \u201cThese numbers are rather consistent with the bleak picture painted by business surveys, showing an ongoing contraction of activity,\u201d wrote Fran\u00e7ois Cabau and Phillippe Gudin of Barclays Capital in a note to clients. If peripheral countries simply had fixed exchange rates, rather than a common currency, they could and almost certainly would have devalued their currencies long before now. That is the normal prescription for countries in financial distress. Couple it with austerity and revivals can be surprisingly rapid, as exports surge and imports plunge. As it is, the process is sure to be long and painful, but not certain to succeed. As Europe stumbles and slows, there has been a temptation in the United States to turn our attention elsewhere, to Asia for economic reasons and to the Mideast for political ones. Mr. Romney has tried to add South America to that mix. But neither the Romney nor Obama campaign has wanted to talk much about Europe, a fact that has been noted with a little alarm in Europe. Richard Lambert, the chancellor of Britain\u2019s Warwick University \u2014 and a former editor of The Financial Times as well as a former central banker \u2014 was in New York this week trying to convince Americans that they should care, and predicting that the euro will survive. \u201cThe European Union has the capacity to get its affairs into order, if it has the political determination to do so,\u201d he said in a speech at New York University. \u201cThis is a crisis about economic imbalances within the euro zone, more than it is about fault lines with the rest of the world.\u201d That is a point worth remembering. The euro zone as a whole is running smaller budget and current account deficits than is the United States. If it were one country, there might be articles about depressed regions, but not talk of collapse. But it is not one country. It is taking halting steps in that direction, with a move to unified bank supervision, but political union is not going to happen; Angela Merkel\u2019s name is never going to be on a ballot outside of Germany. Nor is there going to be easy labor mobility around Europe, even though that is supposedly guaranteed now. Cultural and language differences assure that. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com\/economix."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html","body":"BEIJING \u2014 The mother of China\u2019s prime minister was a schoolteacher in northern China. His father was ordered to tend pigs in one of Mao\u2019s political campaigns. And during childhood, \u201cmy family was extremely poor,\u201d the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, said in a speech last year.But now 90, the prime minister\u2019s mother, Yang Zhiyun, not only left poverty behind, she became outright rich, at least on paper, according to corporate and regulatory records. Just one investment in her name, in a large Chinese financial services company, had a value of $120 million five years ago, the records show. The details of how Ms. Yang, a widow, accumulated such wealth are not known, or even if she was aware of the holdings in her name. But it happened after her son was elevated to China\u2019s ruling elite, first in 1998 as vice prime minister and then five years later as prime minister. Many relatives of Wen Jiabao, including his son, daughter, younger brother and brother-in-law, have become extraordinarily wealthy during his leadership, an investigation by The New York Times shows. A review of corporate and regulatory records indicates that the prime minister\u2019s relatives \u2014 some of whom, including his wife, have a knack for aggressive deal making \u2014 have controlled assets worth at least $2.7 billion. In many cases, the names of the relatives have been hidden behind layers of partnerships and investment vehicles involving friends, work colleagues and business partners. Untangling their financial holdings provides an unusually detailed look at how politically connected people have profited from being at the intersection of government and business as state influence and private wealth converge in China\u2019s fast-growing economy. Unlike most new businesses in China, the family\u2019s ventures sometimes received financial backing from state-owned companies, including China Mobile, one of the country\u2019s biggest phone operators, the documents show. At other times, the ventures won support from some of Asia\u2019s richest tycoons. The Times found that Mr. Wen\u2019s relatives accumulated shares in banks, jewelers, tourist resorts, telecommunications companies and infrastructure projects, sometimes by using offshore entities. The holdings include a villa development project in Beijing; a tire factory in northern China; a company that helped build some of Beijing\u2019s Olympic stadiums, including the well-known \u201cBird\u2019s Nest\u201d; and Ping An Insurance, one of the world\u2019s biggest financial services companies. As prime minister in an economy that remains heavily state-driven, Mr. Wen, who is best known for his simple ways and common touch, more importantly has broad authority over the major industries where his relatives have made their fortunes. Chinese companies cannot list their shares on a stock exchange without approval from agencies overseen by Mr. Wen, for example. He also has the power to influence investments in strategic sectors like energy and telecommunications. Because the Chinese government rarely makes its deliberations public, it is not known what role \u2014 if any \u2014 Mr. Wen, who is 70, has played in most policy or regulatory decisions. But in some cases, his relatives have sought to profit from opportunities made possible by those decisions. The prime minister\u2019s younger brother, for example, has a company that was awarded more than $30 million in government contracts and subsidies to handle wastewater treatment and medical waste disposal for some of China\u2019s biggest cities, according to estimates based on government records. The contracts were announced after Mr. Wen ordered tougher regulations on medical waste disposal in 2003 after the SARS outbreak. In 2004, after the State Council, a government body Mr. Wen presides over, exempted Ping An Insurance and other companies from rules that limited their scope, Ping An went on to raise $1.8 billion in an initial public offering of stock. Partnerships controlled by Mr. Wen\u2019s relatives \u2014 along with their friends and colleagues \u2014 made a fortune by investing in the company before the public offering. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/zte-reports-first-quarterly-loss.html","body":"HONG KONG \u2014 ZTE, one of the world\u2019s biggest mobile phone and telecommunications equipment manufacturers, reported Thursday a net loss of 1.95 billion renminbi for July to September, its first quarterly loss. The company, based in Shenzhen, China, and led by Shi Lirong, had warned this month that its quarterly loss could be as much as 2 billion renminbi, or $320 million: eight times the size of its profit in the first half of the year. The warning brought a 16 percent drop in its stock price Oct. 15, a series of broker downgrades and warnings from the Fitch ratings agency. The slide \u2014 compared with a profit of 299 million renminbi a year ago \u2014 was the result of fierce competition, revenue accounting changes, delayed orders in Africa and chasing market share in Europe through low-margin contracts. But the weak quarter could be a turning point, analysts say, as ZTE should benefit from China Mobile\u2019s expected spending next year to develop its 4G network. \u201cThe worst should be over, but the recovery will depend on how the global economy goes, too,\u201d said Victor Yip, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian. On a conference call after the Oct. 14 profit warning, ZTE executives said third-quarter gross margins had fallen as much as 13 percentage points from the level of a year earlier. Analysts said that would bring margins to a record low of little more than 18 percent. In the first half, ZTE\u2019s gross profit margins had already slipped 2.45 percentage points to less than 27 percent, with margins of its telecommunications equipment business almost double the 16.6 percent margin of its consumer devices division, which makes mobile phones, tablet PCs and the security devices known as dongles. \u201cWe\u2019re always concerned about ZTE\u2019s gross margins,\u201d said Jones Ku, an analyst at Barclays. \u201cThe smartphones margin is probably in the low teens, even lower than in feature phones.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/26iht-hong26.html","body":"HONG KONG \u2014 A small architecture firm in Hong Kong has come up with an unusual proposal for what to do about the worsening shortage of cemetery space in a crowded and expensive city: Build one that can float. The structure conceived by the company, Bread Studio, could hold hundreds of thousands of the boxlike niches that are the final resting places for most people in Hong Kong nowadays. It would float in the sea off the hilly islands and peninsulas that make up Hong Kong and dock only during the twice-yearly festivals when Hong Kong residents descend in large family groups on the city\u2019s cemeteries to pay their respects to the departed. \u201cI realized that cemeteries compete against many other uses for land \u2014 but that we\u2019re not using all that water we have here in Hong Kong,\u201d said Paul Mui, a designer at Bread Studio. \u201cSo why not build a boat and float it out into the ocean?\u201c So far, the Floating Eternity project has not advanced much beyond Bread Studio\u2019s drawing board, and it remains to be seen whether a structure of the sort would ever draw serious interest from developers or get the go-ahead from the Hong Kong authorities. Still, even if it is never built, the fact that architects in Hong Kong are thinking so laterally highlights the unusual nature of the city\u2019s property market. Retail space is more expensive to rent in Hong Kong than anywhere else in the world; no offices command higher rents than those in the main financial district, Central. At an average of about $2,670 per square meter, or $248 per square foot per year, office space in the neighborhood\u2019s gleaming skyscrapers will set you back nearly twice as much as in London, according to recent research by the real estate services firm CBRE. Home prices, too, have climbed to their highest levels ever, with a 16 percent rise so far this year alone, despite concerns about the economic slowdown in mainland China. At the luxury end of the market, Swire Properties sold a 628-square-meter, or 6,760-square-foot, apartment in August for 430 million Hong Kong dollars, or $55.5 million. An apartment in the same building, designed by Frank Gehry, was leased for 850,000 dollars per month for a three-year period. \u201cHong Kong is a very unusual and complex market,\u201d said Paul Louie, an analyst at the Japanese investment bank Nomura. Some of the normal rules of economics, he said, do not come into play in this market, where supply has been unable to match the swelling tide of demand. A unique blend of geography, economics, social preferences and financial policy is at work in the city of 7.1 million. Rapid economic and population growth \u2014 Hong Kong now has more than twice as many inhabitants as it did 50 years ago \u2014 have created a ravenous appetite for housing and commercial space. The phenomenon in itself is not unique; rapid economic expansion has caused property prices to rise in many developing countries. But in Hong Kong, several factors give it an extra kick. Because Hong Kong\u2019s currency is fixed to the U.S. dollar, interest rates, as in the United States, will remain at ultralow levels until at least mid-2015. Unlike the United States, however, the city has a low jobless rate, at just 3.3 percent, so Hong Kongers have the confidence to buy, despite the clouds hanging over the global economy, said Marcos Chan, a researcher at the real estate services firm Jones Lang LaSalle. Hong Kong\u2019s ties with mainland China have turbocharged the property market even more. The handover from British control in 1997 increased the city\u2019s importance as an entry point for foreign companies doing business with the mainland. It also brought a tremendous influx of money from mainland Chinese, who see Hong Kong as an easy and attractive destination for their savings. Mr. Louie, the Nomura analyst, estimates that 18 percent of property transactions in the city involved mainland Chinese buyers, up from 15 percent three years ago. And, he said, the increase was likely to continue. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/economy\/jobless-claims-drop-while-capital-goods-orders-stall.html","body":"WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Companies are holding off on purchases of computers, industrial equipment and other long-lasting manufactured goods, a trend that is slowing the American economy.A fourth straight month of lackluster corporate spending led some economists on Thursday to trim their forecasts for growth in the July-September quarter. The government will issue its first estimate of third-quarter growth on Friday, the last snapshot of overall economic activity before the presidential election. The report on business confidence overshadowed a drop in applications for unemployment aid and a slight increase in the number of people who signed contracts to buy homes. Orders for durable goods, products expected to last at least three years, rose 9.9 percent in September, the Commerce Department said. But most of the increase was driven by a spike in aircraft orders, which are volatile and plummeted in the previous month. Economists pay closer attention to core capital goods, which include machinery and computers but exclude aircraft. Those orders were unchanged in September after only a slight gain in August and steep declines in July and June. And shipments of those goods fell for the third straight month. That means business spending on equipment and software probably declined 4.9 percent in the July-September quarter, economists said. It would represent the first drop in that category since the recession. Corporate investment helped the American economy emerge from the recession three years ago. But businesses have grown more cautious since spring, seeing tepid growth in consumer spending and declines in exports. The disappointing report on durable goods led several economists to downgrade their forecasts for third-quarter economic growth. Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, lowered his forecast to an annual rate of 1.6 percent, down from 1.8 percent. Peter Newland, an economist at Barclays Capital, reduced his forecast to a rate of 1.8 percent from 2 percent. Either figure would reflect little improvement from the April-June growth rate of 1.3 percent. Sluggish business investment has burdened job creation at American factories. Manufacturers slashed 20,000 jobs in the third quarter. Factories added 194,000 jobs in the previous three quarters. A separate report Thursday suggested hiring remains modest, at best. Weekly applications for unemployment benefits fell last week to a seasonally adjusted 369,000, stabilizing after two weeks in which seasonal factors distorted the data. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, rose to 368,000, the Labor Department said. Applications are a proxy for layoffs. A number below 375,000 suggests hiring is strong enough to lower the unemployment rate. Applications have fluctuated between 360,000 and 390,000 since January. At the same time, employers have added an average of nearly 150,000 jobs a month. That is barely enough to lower the unemployment rate, which declined to 7.8 percent in September from 8.3 percent earlier this year. A third report on Thursday showed the housing recovery may be cooling off. The National Association of Realtors\u2019s index of sales agreements showed that the number of Americans who signed contracts to buy homes rose slightly in September from August. That suggests sales may level off in the coming months after solid gains in the past year."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/arts\/design\/museum-and-gallery-listings-for-oct-26-nov-1.html","body":"ArtMuseums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted.

Museums Asia Society and Museum: \u2018Bound Unbound: Lin Tianmiao\u2019 (through Jan. 27) Lin Tianmiao is one of a rare kind in China, where she lives: a nationally and internationally renowned female artist. This museumwide show presents installations that have not been widely seen. Influenced by American artists like Kiki Smith, Louise Bourgeois and Ann Hamilton \u2014 who made the female body and traditional women\u2019s occupations hot topics during the 1990s when Ms. Lin was living in New York \u2014 these productions are not particularly original.

(Ken Johnson) Brooklyn Museum: \u2018Jean-Michel Othoniel: My Way\u2019 (through Dec. 2) Some of the art in this whimsical but cloying midcareer survey can strike you as the sculptural equivalent of haute couture. A bed framed by Murano glass beads is accompanied by veils of tulle, each one hand embroidered with gold thread in a workshop established by Louis XIV. Elsewhere, 4,200 yellow blown-glass bricks, shaped by artisans from Firozabad, India, form a shimmering rectangular solid. Early works in wax, sulfur and obsidian are more personal and provocative, showing the influence of mentors and peers like Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Robert Gober, Sophie Calle and Annette Messager. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg) \u2605 Brooklyn Museum: \u2018Mickalene Thomas: Origin of the Universe\u2019 (through Jan. 20) This invigorating exhibition is dominated by big, brash collage-like paintings, thick with color and studded with rhinestones that depict cacophonous landscapes, spatially skewed interiors and, best of all, images of imperious black women among swaths of brightly patterned fabrics. Building on Conceptual identity art, borrowing from art history and 1970s blaxploitation extravagance, they subvert prevailing notions of beauty and taste and subvert the male gaze while offering resounding proof that the political, not only the personal, can also be stunningly pictorial.

Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art\u2019 (through Feb. 3) This big, intellectually enthralling exhibition of Conceptual works from the 1960s and early \u201970s is not a conventional museum period survey. Rather, it approximates how the rise of Conceptualism was seen while it was happening by one person: the curator, critic and writer Lucy R. Lippard, who was an extraordinarily energetic participant in and promoter of a trend that brought us the triumph of mind over matter in art. Anyone who wants art to be radically defiant of the market-driven system must see it. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

Be warned: the thematically arranged show throws you into history at the deep end. Almost all the information is strictly visual; there are very few explanatory labels anywhere. But the visuals are so rich, and interact so provocatively, that you may well be inspired to go out and do some homework and come back for a second look. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org; Also on display at Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter) Metropolitan Museum of Art: \u2018Faking It: Manipulated Photography Before Photoshop\u2019 (through Jan. 27) This absorbing, often amusing exhibition offers abundant evidence that photographers have been cheating since shortly after the medium\u2019s invention almost two centuries ago. It features prints dating from 1846 to the early \u201990s made from altered negatives; seemingly realistic images made by piecing together two or more negatives; hand-colored black-and-white prints; Surrealistic montages; and conceptual confections contesting the ideal of photographic truth. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson) \u2605 Guggenheim Museum: \u2018Picasso Black and White\u2019 (through Jan. 23) Billed as the first monochromatic look at Picasso\u2019s whole career, this exhibition is as eye-opening as it is elegant. That\u2019s especially true among the later works on the upper ramps, which push well past the obligatory Neo-Classicism and Analytic Cubism into bracingly sensual explorations of the figure, strident political cries de coeur \u00e0 la Guernica, and winking homages to Delacroix and Vel\u00e1zquez. Also notable: Thirty eight of the show\u2019s 118 works have never been exhibited in this country, and 5, among them the sharply angular \u201cBust of a Woman With a Hat\u201d (1939), have never been on view publicly. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org.

But it\u2019s pitched as much to the mind, as to the heart. On the one hand, it\u2019s a grand narrative of stirring sights: ardent faces, agitated bodies, camaraderie, clenched fists, funerals. It\u2019s also a disquisition on the ordinariness of goodness and evil, on how people in a particular time and place encounter and partake of both, and go on with their lives. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org.

He did, however, use clay to work out his ideas, and he probably produced thousands of studies in that generously plastic material. But today only 52 pieces in clay are known to have been made by him, and this revealing exhibition presents 39 of them. They range from small, quickly made sketches of angels and other beings that today look surprisingly modern to an amazing, half-size lion pausing to drink from an invisible pool.

But with 100 often significant works by 59 other relentlessly predictable artists \u2014 including Gerhard Richter, Cindy Sherman and Jeff Koons \u2014 it is largely a shapeless, enthusiastic muddle.

The none-too-high standards of participatory fun-house formalism are met; those of conventional plop art are barely exceeded. In the fusion of architecture, art and science, art is the loser, but the views of Central Park\u2019s ocean of greenness thrill, providing an immense and calming relief to the work\u2019s forced and busy artifice.

That\u2019s the impression given by the 80 paintings and objects that make up this fragrant exhibition, drawn entirely from the museum\u2019s deep holdings, about paradises lost and found; about nature blooming and fading; about cosmological events transpiring in backyard bamboo groves.

Doris Duke, the owner, referred to it as a \u201cSpanish-Moorish-Persian-Indian complex.\u201d Whatever you call it, it looks magnificent in this show and the accompanying book. Both combine sparkling new color shots of the home and gardens taken by Tim Street-Porter; architectural documents and vintage photographs; pieces of the collection; and projects by contemporary artists who had residencies at Shangri La (which has served, since Duke\u2019s death in 1993, as the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art). 2 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg) \u2605 Museum of Modern Art: \u2018Born Out of Necessity\u2019 (through Jan. 28) The title may or may not have an extra preposition, but the show itself is a fascinating array of recent acquisitions that have a fairly direct bearing on quality of life or actual survival. They range from classic (the 1908 Dixie cup) to cutting edge; cover both analog and digital; and include the tiny (the latest in earplugs) and the quite large (the 1952 United States Army Jeep). Whether born \u201cof\u201d or \u201cout of\u201d necessity, the displays attest to human ingenuity responding to human need. (212) 708-9400, moma.org.

More than 30 years of animated and live-action shorts, television commercials, music videos and imaginative documentaries in particular allow devotees and neophytes alike to grasp the essence of Timothy and Stephen Quay\u2019s achievement and its evolution, strengths and weaknesses all.

Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu\u2019s film \u201cDialogue With Ceausescu\u201d (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler\u2019s \u201cShe Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day\u201d (1976) and Sharon Hayes\u2019s four-channel video \u201cThe Interpreter Project\u201d (2001). Andrea Fraser\u2019s two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera.

It covers the Victorian era to the present, and is particularly rich in images from the mid-20th century. A smaller companion exhibition, \u201cCity Scenes: Highlights of New York Street Photography,\u201d provides an opportunity to compare and contrast two very different modern cities as they grappled with war, the postindustrial era and various forms of social tension.

Thus ring the basic themes that unfold in this extraordinarily touching show of late works by the Swiss Symbolist: Self, Other, Love, Death and World. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson) \u2605 Rubin Museum of Art: \u2018Candid: The Lens and Life of Homai Vyarawalla\u2019 (through Jan. 14) The Indian photojournalist Homai Vyarawalla (1913-2012) was on the spot time and again to record the history of modern South Asia being made. This small, evocative, event-filled retrospective catches highlights of her career, including her coverage of Mohandas Gandhi\u2019s funeral; important events in the career of the charismatic Jawaharlal Nehru; and visits from Nikita Khrushchev, Ho Chi Minh and Jacqueline Kennedy. As one of the few female photographers in the Indian press corps in her day, Ms. Vyarawalla was a pioneer; in 1970 she abruptly put down her camera and disappeared until her recent rediscovery by younger peers. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter) \u2605 South Street Seaport Museum: \u2018Compass: Folk Art in Four Directions\u2019 (through Feb. 3) The American Folk Art Museum presents some 200 works from its unparalleled collection in this beautifully orchestrated exhibition. Paintings, sculpture, textiles, scrimshaw, painted furniture and much, much more are arrayed along themes that reflect the history of Lower Manhattan \u2014 seafaring, commerce, social life and that all-important factor, the weather \u2014 but not too tightly. Poetic license is taken, yielding an intricate constellation of connected artworks, histories and concerns that highlights one of the city\u2019s great treasures. 12 Fulton Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 748-8600, southstreetseaportmuseum.org. (Smith) \u2605 Whitney Museum of American Art: \u2018Wade Guyton: OS\u2019 (through Jan. 13) Something of a rarity this fall season, a beautiful, thoughtfully staged show makes a cogent case for a young painter with no overt political ax to grind working in New York. Made entirely with computer, scanner and printer \u2014 the OS refers to computer operating systems \u2014 his works methodically explore the possibilities of technology as just another if especially up-to-date paintbrush. The results are full of glitches and irregularities that provide their own pictorial life, full of the ghosts of painting past and strikingly original. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith) Galleries: Uptown \u2605 \u2018Echoes of the Past: The Buddhist Cave Temples of Xiangtangshan\u2019 (through Jan. 6) In the Buddhist way of thinking, all things must pass, though that seems a shame if they\u2019re as out-of-this-world beautiful as Chinese Buddhist art is. But could that vision of transience be changing in the 21st century, as still-crude technology lets images live on out there in digital clouds? Regret and hope alike run through this multifaceted show that presents a dozen gorgeous sixth-century sculptures and a digital simulation of the cave temple in China from which some of them were long ago removed.

(Cotter) \u00a0 Galleries: Chelsea Robert Adams: \u2018On Any Given Day in Spring and Light Balances\u2019 (through Nov. 3) Two new series of landscape photographs attest to the almost classical lucidity of this esteemed American photographer\u2019s work, his passion for nature and his impeccable printing technique. Spare, calligraphic images record the movements of flocks of shorebirds, known as brant, at high tide, while lushly dappled views of Edenic forests demonstrate that few subjects catch the play of light and shadow so basic to photography as richly as leaves and trees. Matthew Marks Gallery, 526 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarksgallery.com. (Smith) \u2605 \u2018Distance and Desire\u2019: \u2018Encounters with the African Archive, Part I: Santu Mofokeng and A.M. Duggan-Cronin\u2019 (through Nov. 17) Born in Ireland in 1874, Alfred Martin Duggan-Cronin photographed in South Africa until his death in 1954, creating a multivolume book \u2014 a record of indigenous peoples and of ways of life that he feared were disappearing. In 1997, Santu Mofokeng, born in Johannesburg in 1956, completed a book-length compilation of urban African studio portraits dating to the colonial era. The Duggan-Cronin photographs, seen in mounted pages from his books in this show, perpetuate an old view of Africans as being, by definition, rural, tradition-bound, on the verge of extinction. The studio portraits gathered in Mr. Mofokeng\u2019s archive present Africans as they chose to see themselves, as global citizens with modern histories.

(Cotter) \u2605 Thomas Hirschhorn: \u2018Timeline: Work in Public Space\u2019 (through Nov. 3) Running concurrently with his installation at Gladstone Gallery, Thomas Hirschhorn\u2019s \u201cTimeline: Work in Public Space\u201d is a dense collage of text and photos that guides you through Mr. Hirschhorn\u2019s public artworks. (It\u2019s a prelude to his \u201cGramsci Monument,\u201d a Dia project in the Bronx that\u2019s slated for summer 2013.) The jumble of texts, photographs and diagrams looks provisional, which suits the unfinished space and, more important, Mr. Hirschhorn\u2019s ideas about public art (a term he likes to disparage, saying, \u201cArt is public\u201d). Dia:Chelsea, 541 West 22nd Street; (212) 989-5566, diaart.org. (Rosenberg) \u2018We the People\u2019 (through Nov. 9) Timed to coincide with the final weeks of the presidential election, this enervating exhibition of works by 68 artists extols American democracy. It includes patriotic posters by Norman Rockwell and LeRoy Neiman, but the overall drift is, unsurprisingly, to the left. There are paintings by Alice Neel, Nicole Eisenman and, most prominently, a billboard-size portrait of Mitt Romney by Richard Phillips. Sculptors include Duane Hanson, creator of a startling super-realistic portrait of a scruffy youth titled \u201cHigh School Student.\u201d Robert Rauschenberg Foundation Project Space, 455 West 19th Street, (212) 228-5283, rauschenbergfoundation.org. (Johnson) \u2605 Helen Miranda Wilson: \u2018New Paintings\u2019 (through Nov. 10) Painted with loving care on small panels, Ms. Wilson\u2019s works display compositions made mainly of thin stripes in lush, saturated colors. In most there are hypnotic optical effects. Concentric circles pulse and spin. Horizontal bands dip and bulge. Lines defining shapes like bowling pins suggest spectral human figures with radiating auras. Here is proof that beauty is not just in the beholder\u2019s eye. Lori Bookstein, 138 10th Avenue, (212) 750-0949, loribooksteinfineart.com. (Johnson) Galleries: SoHo Bernadette Corporation: \u20182000 Wasted Years\u2019 (through Dec. 16) A Warholian spoof of branding, publicity and media, this retrospective of the influential collaborative known as the Bernadette Corporation is depressingly arch. Resembling an ultra-hip design and fashion firm\u2019s showroom, the installation includes mannequins in avant-garde clothes; videos of runway shows; scarves and other accessories produced by the Bernadette Corporation; conceptually pointed publications; and a trailer for a documentary about the riots during the 2001 G-8 summit in Genoa with commentary by the actress Chlo\u00eb Sevigny. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, (212) 226-3970, artistsspace.org. (Johnson) Galleries: Other \u2605 Tony Conrad: \u2018Doing the City: Urban Community Interventions\u2019 (through Nov. 3) Tony Conrad has slowly been emerging from avant-gardist obscurity, and it\u2019s about time. His multifold career \u2014 as experimental film and video maker, composer, musician and sound artist \u2014 still looks radical and prescient a half-century after it began. This show includes haunting 1969 sound pieces, and films and videos made in the past and finished in the present. 80WSE Gallery, New York University, 80 Washington Square East, (212) 998-5747, steinhardt.nyu.edu\/80wse. (Cotter) \u2605 \u2018A Disagreeable Object\u2019 (through Nov. 26) This group show uses a phrase from Giacometti to lend some context to a present in which casual attitudes toward sculpture have become commonplace and plenty of value, material and otherwise, is attached to objects without pedestals. The main point here is a new-old one: what looks like cheerful insouciance about the art object is actually a deadly serious reaction to the vagaries of war, technology and the economy. SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Rosenberg) \u2018The Islands of Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot: Fractals, Chaos, and the Materiality of Thinking\u2019 (through Jan. 27) This heady, compact exhibition presents efforts from the 1960s and \u201970s to visualize a species of mathematical formulas known as fractals, a term coined by the mathematician Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot (1924-2012). The visual impact of the computer printouts, short films, 3-D models, letters, sketches and Polaroids on display is low, but the philosophical import is great considering the enormous advances in scientific imaging technology that have happened since those early days. Bard Graduate Center, 18 West 86th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3023, bgc.bard.edu. (Johnson) \u2605 Simon Dinnerstein: \u2018The Fulbright Triptych\u2019 (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children\u2019s drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info. (Smith) \u2605 Penny Slinger: \u2018An Exorcism Revisited\u2019 (through Nov. 30) Born in England, Penny Slinger emerged from art school in 1969, a time when lots of liberations were under way, including the nascent women\u2019s movement. The earliest works in her first New York solo are six short films from that year. They\u2019re student pieces, but pretty out there for the time. The main piece is her still unpublished book of photo-collages and texts called \u201cAn Exorcism.\u201d A blend of \u201cRebecca\u201d and \u201cStory of O,\u201d it\u2019s yet another reminder of the adventure that feminist art in the 1960s and \u201970s was.

(Cotter) Toxic Beauty: \u2018The Art of Frank Moore\u2019 (through Dec. 8) This lavishly detailed retrospective pays tribute to a multifaceted career in painting, set design, film and political activism that was cut short by AIDS in 2002, when the artist was 48. In a time \u2014 the 1980s and \u201990s \u2014 when some artists re-embraced representational painting and others tackled thorny political topics, Moore did both, and with unusual flair, reviving and revising a panoply of outr\u00e9 realist styles in luminous allegorical canvases that comment on, and link, environmental degradation and the tragedy of AIDS.

(Smith) Public Art \u2018Common Ground\u2019 (through Nov. 30) Located on a site known in the 17th century as the Commons \u2014 which also served as the site of Bloombergville, the precursor to Occupy Wall Street one year ago \u2014 this show offers some incendiary critiques. Ian Hamilton Finlay\u2019s group of stone slabs arranged on a patch of grass includes inscriptions from the writings of Louis de Saint-Just (1767-94), a French Revolutionary leader. Paul McCarthy\u2019s \u201cDaddies Ketchup\u201d (2001), a huge inflatable bottle of ketchup makes a Neo-Pop-psychoanalytic connection between patriarchy and power, and Elmgreen & Dragset\u2019s aluminum bullhorn housed in a slick, industrial vitrine evokes protesters in Zuccotti Park, who were forbidden from using any amplification devices, developed a signature form of analogue augmentation, the \u201cpeople\u2019s microphone.\u201d City Hall Park, Public Art Fund, (212) 223-7800, publicartfund.org. (Schwendener) \u2605 Tatzu Nishi: \u2018Discovering Columbus\u2019 (through Nov. 18) In his first commission in the United States, a Japanese artist known for temporarily privatizing monuments and landmarks around the globe by building fully outfitted living rooms or hotel suites around them, takes on the statue of Christopher Columbus perched above Columbus Circle. A free timed ticket and a six-story climb (or elevator ride) yields the semi-Surreal sight of the sculpture presiding over an upscale living room. But the ravishing views may be the main treat. Open daily, from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., at Columbus Circle, at Broadway and Central Park South. Free tickets available at publicartfund.org, (866) 607-5461 or the information desk at the Shops at Columbus Circle, third floor. (Smith) Out of Town \u2605 Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden: \u2018Ai Weiwei: According to What?\u2019 (through Feb. 24) As seen in its first American survey, the work of the lionhearted Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, is no match for his prominent role as a human rights advocate. The sculptures and installation pieces too often adhere to the fashionable international genre of handsome, Conceptually generated artworks. Explanatory labels do much of the heavy lifting, along with historically-charged materials and objects, like Chinese antique furniture and wood from destroyed Qing dynasty temples. The artist\u2019s photographs and videos suggest that his documentary work may be best. On the National Mall, at Independence Avenue Southwest and Seventh Street, Washington, (202) 633-4674, hirshhorn.si.edu; free. (Smith) \u2018Anti-Establishment\u2019 (through Dec. 21) Contrary to this muddled exhibition\u2019s title, the artists it presents are not uncompromising rebels. The show\u2019s curator, Johanna Burton, avers that they imagine \u201cnovel collective relationships and emergent models of engaged citizenship,\u201d but much of the work is more self-reflexively preoccupied with art than with worldly affairs. Best of all is a room full of Abstract Expressionist-style paintings made with Day-Glo paints by Jacqueline Humphries displayed under ultra violet light. It is a lushly visual trip. Hessel Museum of Art, Bard College Center for Curatorial Studies, Annandale-on-Hudson, (845) 758-7598, bard.edu\/ccs. (Johnson) \u2018From 199A to 199B: Liam Gillick\u2019 (through Dec. 21) Mr. Gillick is a nearly ubiquitous figure on the international art scene as a conceptual artist, speaker, writer and collaborator with other luminaries like Rirkrit Tiravanija and Pierre Huyghe. He designs shiny, quasi-architectural sculptures for sale in commercial galleries, but here the focus is on politically motivated conceptual projects from the 1990s. If sociology and ideology are your things, this show is for you. Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, (845) 758-7598, bard.edu\/ccs. (Johnson) Institute of Contemporary Art, Pennsylvania: \u2018Jeremy Deller: Joy in People\u2019 (through Dec. 30) The British artist Jeremy Deller, the subject of this thought-provoking show, is the anti-Damien Hirst. He has fashioned a Turner Prize-winning career devoted to breaking down the traditional walls between art and the world at large. Rather than producing visually arresting objects for sale in antiseptic galleries he has organized parades; created odd signs and bumper stickers; made a film about Depeche Mode fans around the world; and orchestrated a historical re-enactment of a large, violent conflict between striking coal miners and police in Orgreave, in South Yorkshire, in 1984. University of Pennsylvania, 118 South 36th Street, Philadelphia, (215) 898-7108, icaphila.org. (Johnson) \u2018Light and Landscape\u2019 (through Nov. 11) Temporary exhibitions at this bucolic art park have not been notably cutting edge, but this show of Postmodernist sculptures relating to light organized by the center\u2019s new associate curator, Nora Lawrence, may signal a promising change in the program. It includes indoor works by Roni Horn, Alyson Shotz and Diana Thater and elaborate outdoor constructions by Spencer Finch and William Lamson. Most surprising is Peter Coffin\u2019s \u201cUntitled (Sunshine),\u201d which consists of four loud speakers attached to a tall pole on a grassy hill broadcasting sunny keyboard melodies composed and performed by the jazz musician Bob James. Storm King Art Center, Old Pleasant Hill Road, Mountainville, N.Y., (845) 534-3115, stormkingartcenter.org. (Johnson) \u2605 Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art: \u2018Oh Canada\u2019 (through April 8) Seesawing between bigness and intimacy, the personal and the communal, this 62-artist survey of contemporary art in the Great White North may tell you more about Canada\u2019s identity crisis than it does about Canadian art. A sense of place, if not nationhood, does emerge in stark photographs of Newfoundland by Ned Pratt and Kim Morgan\u2019s hanging latex cast of a lighthouse on Prince Edward Island. Elsewhere, cartoonlike pencil drawings by Annie Pootoogook and Shuvinai Ashoona depict contemporary Inuit life and the artist Amalie Atkins stars in a prairie fairy tale involving musical wolves and bears with golden teeth. 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, (413) 662-2111, massmoca.org. (Rosenberg) National Gallery of Art: \u2018Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective\u2019 (through Jan. 13) The first major survey of this Pop artist\u2019s career work since his death, at 73, in 1997, is a big show and has some slow spots, but on the whole it moves right along. As always, Lichtenstein\u2019s large-featured images, with their Ben-Day dot patterns; thick, black contours; and flat, bright colors are almost ergonomically comfortable to the eye. On the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter) \u2605 National Museum of African Art: \u2018African Cosmos: Stellar Arts\u2019 (through Dec. 9) Packed with celestial bodies and patches of darkness sending forth light, this show is about the extent and persistence of cosmological consciousness in art, old and new, from the African continent. It\u2019s also a bold demonstration of a more specific reality: that in Africa, art and science, including astronomy, have always intersected, and continue to, whether in prayers on an ancient Egyptian mummy case asking that the deceased owner be lifted to the stars or in a contemporary video projection that simulates the aurora borealis. Visitors to the National Museum of African Art should also take in the smart, stimulating reinstallation of the permanent collection. Smithsonian Institution, 950 Independence Avenue SW, Washington, (202) 633-4600, africa.si.edu. (Cotter) Last Chance \u2605 Robert Adams: \u2018The Place We Live, A Retrospective Selection of Photographs\u2019 (closes on Sunday) A prophet in the wilderness of modernity, the photographer Robert Adams has devoted almost five decades to decrying what fecklessly industrious humans have done to the landscape of the American West. This splendid retrospective show of more than 250 prints from the late 1960s to 2009 surveys an oeuvre that is as compelling for its understated metaphorical resonance as for its moral ferocity. Yale University Art Gallery, 111 Chapel Street, New Haven, (203) 432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu. (Johnson) Jonah Freeman and Justin Lowe: \u2018Stray Light Grey\u2019 (closes on Saturday) Your journey through this immersive installation begins in a janitor\u2019s closet. From there you pass through a grungy bathroom, an abandoned Off Track Betting parlor, a plastic surgeon\u2019s office and a store stocked with nutritional supplements like \u201cDNA Recalibrator.\u201d Finally you emerge into a library displaying fake books with titles like \u201cThe Decorated Slave State\u201d and \u201cFun With Your Interneurons.\u201d You may wish you could see the unmade movie for which all this would make an excellent set. Marlborough Chelsea, 545 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-8634, marlboroughchelsea.com. (Johnson) \u2605 Ralph Humphrey (through Saturday) With rich, soft colors, abrasive, stucco-like surfaces and boxy, built-out forms, the painter Ralph Humphrey (1932-90) put his own idiosyncratic spin on longstanding formalist concerns. He pit the retinal against the physical and pushed the modernist monochrome toward representation with results at once comic and subtly elegiac. This survey of works form the 1970s and \u201980s should encourage a museum show. Gary Snyder Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-1351, garysnyderart.com. (Smith) \u2605 Jesper Just: \u2018This Nameless Spectacle\u2019 (closes on Saturday) Grand mal, la petit mort or divine revelation? The question lingers in the wake of Mr. Just\u2019s astounding, 13-minute video \u201cThis Nameless Spectacle.\u201d On opposite walls, two extremely wide-screen projections follow the peregrinations of a woman rolling herself along in a wheelchair in Paris followed by a young man who might be a stalker and might be an incarnation of the demigod Eros. The climax resembles a scene from David Lynch\u2019s \u201cInland Empire.\u201d James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 714-9500, jamescohan.com. (Johnson) \u2605 Zoe Leonard: \u2018453 West 17th Street\u2019 (closes on Oct. 27) The idea that photographs no longer take up much physical space seems to have inspired a wave of installations, among them the simple but enticing walk-in camera obscura in Zoe Leonard\u2019s current show.\u00a0As light passes through a small window into a darkened gallery, the streetscape outside is projected onto the walls and ceiling. The images are inverted, so that taxis appear to cross overhead and the tops of the high-rises across West 17th Street point toward the floor.\u00a0Ms. Leonard also offers up a sort of ghost twin to the camera obscura: a brightly lighted, blindingly white room of prints made by aiming the camera at the sun.

(Rosenberg) \u2605 Daniel Joseph Martinez: \u2018I Want to Go to Detroit: Cheerleaders Cheer\u2019 (closes on Sunday) The two series of photographs in this show are from the late 1970s and are indicators of what would be one of several continuing theme in this artist\u2019s work: the body as a malleable, manipulatable, invariably political instrument, capable of many potential uses and carrying many conflicting messages. A second exhibition, with exceptionally powerful new photographs by Mr. Martinez touching on the same theme, opens at the gallery on Nov. 4. Simon Preston Gallery, 301 Broome Street, Lower East Side, (212) 431-1105, simonprestongallery.com. (Cotter) \u2605 \u2018James Welling: Overflow\u2019 (closes on Oct. 27) In his latest body of work, the photographer James Welling rediscovers his\u00a0teenage fascination\u00a0with Andrew Wyeth\u2019s sentimental realist paintings and re-embraces them with a more sophisticated eye.\u00a0Visiting places where the painter lived and worked \u2014 including a farmhouse in Chadds Ford, Pa., and the famous Olson House in Cushing, Me., seen in\u00a0\u201cChristina\u2019s World\u201d\u00a0 \u2014 Mr. Welling\u00a0zeros in on paint-splattered easels and bottles of dry pigment, pokes around dusty corners of barns and churches, and pulls back to show the saltwater farm of the Olson House as Christina might have seen it.\u00a0 David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com. (Rosenberg) \u2605 Whitney Museum of American Art: \u2018Fireflies on the Water\u2019 (closes on Sunday) The museum\u2019s retrospective of the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama has closed but visitors can still view this 2002 installation, which depicts a seemingly endless space. It\u2019s a carefully constructed environment of lights, mirrors and water in which viewers can transcend their very sense of self. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter) \u2605 Whitney Museum of American Art: \u2018Oskar Fischinger: Space Light Art \u2014 A Film Environment\u2019 (closes on Sunday) Projected on three adjoining screens, \u201cLight Space Art\u201d floods your retinas with intensely colorful, pulsating circles, flowing lines and blinking rectangles. A found film clip shows a spinning globe and the momentary, cartoon apparition of a young girl in a hooded, fur-trimmed coat. Oskar Fischinger created the original film footage in Weimar-era Germany. Newly restored and digitized, it still generates an exhilarating phantasmagoria of abstraction and metaphor. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Johnson) Whitney Museum of American Art: \u2018Signs & Symbols\u2019 (closes on Sunday) In the 1950s, Americans were running out of ways to keep their works new and responsive to a world shaken to the core by World War II. For some the solution was passive-aggressive withdrawal into archaic myth, oracular symbolism and private language. Sampling this trend with works from the Whitney\u2019s permanent collection, this show presents lugubriously portentous paintings by hall of famers like Rothko and Pollock and by many journeyman players like Mark Tobey and Forrest Bess.

Next summer the Biennale plans to add pavilions of countries that have never participated before.Paolo Baratta, president of the Biennale, and Massimiliano Gioni, director of the 2013 exhibition, said at a news conference on Thursday at the Biennale\u2019s headquarters, a 15th-century Gothic palazzo overlooking the Grand Canal in Venice, that at least eight additional countries will be represented beyond the 89 that participated in 2011. The newcomers will include the Bahamas, Bahrain, Ivory Coast, Kosovo, Kuwait, the Maldives, Nigeria and Paraguay. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say exactly how many countries in all will be participating,\u201d Mr. Gioni said in a telephone interview. The theme of the 2013 Biennale, from June 1 to Nov. 24, will be \u201cThe Encyclopedic Palace,\u201d a phrase drawn from the title of a symbol of 1950s-era Futurism, an 11-foot-tall architectural model of a 136-story cylindrical skyscraper intended by its creator for the National Mall in Washington. The model, by the self-taught Italian-American artist Marino Auriti, now belongs to the American Folk Art Museum in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s the crazy dream, bordering between knowledge and madness, image and imagination,\u201d Mr. Gioni said, and appropriate for the Biennale because it reflects the grand ambition of this international exhibition. Mr. Gioni added that he hoped the spirit of Auriti\u2019s work would encourage contemporary self-taught artists to join the international mix at the Biennale. A KLINE WORK IS FOR SALE A year ago collectors jumped when four paintings by Clyfford Still went to auction at Sotheby\u2019s on behalf of the City of Denver to raise money for an endowment at the new Clyfford Still Museum, which was poised to open there. Still\u2019s work has not been an auction house staple, and his work tends to sell for far less than paintings by better known Abstract Expressionists like Jackson Pollock or Mark Rothko. So it was a surprise to even the experts when \u201c1949-A-No. 1,\u201d a canvas of thick, jagged brush strokes in deep reds and black, sold for $61.7 million, a record for a Still sold at auction. Next month a painting by another less popular Abstract Expressionist is expected to fetch a record price at auction. On Nov. 14 an untitled painting by Franz Kline from 1957 will go on the block at Christie\u2019s and is expected to bring $20 million to $30 million. That estimate is more than three times the current record auction price for a Kline, set in 2005 when Christie\u2019s sold \u201cCrow Dancer,\u201d a 1958 painting, for $6.4 million. But recently, experts say, four Klines have sold privately for over $20 million apiece. The canvas at Christie\u2019s is from Kline\u2019s series of signature black-and-white abstractions composed of colliding brush strokes sweeping across the canvas. While Christie\u2019s will not say who is selling the painting \u2014 the catalog designation reads \u201cProperty From a Notable Private Collection\u201d \u2014 contemporary art dealers believe it is being consigned by George Roberts, the San Francisco financier, who has owned the painting for nearly a decade. Its provenance is noteworthy: it belonged to Robert Mnuchin, of L&M Arts, the New York gallery, who bought it for his private collection when he was a partner at Goldman Sachs. The painting was also owned by David Geffen, the entertainment mogul with a world-class art collection. A tiny circle next to the lot number in the catalog is Christie\u2019s symbol that the painting has been guaranteed, meaning that the seller has been promised an undisclosed sum regardless of the outcome of the sale. That Christie\u2019s is putting the company\u2019s money behind the painting is a vote of confidence in an uncertain economy. \u201cKline is an artist\u2019s artist,\u201d Brett Gorvy, chairman of Christie\u2019s postwar and contemporary art department, said. \u201cHis work has been undervalued for years, and this painting is one of only a handful of paintings of this caliber by Kline still left in private hands.\u201d NEW SCHOOL\u2019S NEW NEON The New School has commissioned its first site-specific artwork for its new University Center building, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, on the corner of 14th Street and Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village. The work, scheduled to be on view in 2014, will feature text from Walt Whitman\u2019s \u201cLeaves of Grass\u201d rendered in neon lights. It is the creation of Glenn Ligon, an artist known for work that uses phrases written or uttered by personalities or writers he admires, including Mary Shelley, James Baldwin and Malcolm X. When Mr. Ligon, who is African-American, had a midcareer retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art last year, the words \u201cnegro sunshine\u201d appeared on the Whitney\u2019s facade. The phrase, taken from \u201cMelanctha,\u201d a 1909 novella by Gertrude Stein, seemed startling when viewed out of context. A solo show of his neon sculptures opens on Friday at the Luhring Augustine Gallery in Chelsea. Tim Marshall, the New School\u2019s provost, said Mr. Ligon\u2019s work was chosen from proposals solicited from artists selected by the faculty. Mr. Ligon\u2019s piece will be pink neon running around the top of a wall in the center\u2019s first-floor cafe. \u201cIt\u2019s two rows of quotes, or about 400 feet of text,\u201d Mr. Ligon said in an e-mail message. When he decided on that text, he said, he was mostly thinking about \u201cencountering strangers, the life of the street, desiring bodies \u2014 something for students to think about when they are tired of thinking of their G.P.A. or tuition.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/arts\/dance\/dance-listings-for-oct-26-nov-1.html","body":"DanceFull reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com\/dance. \u2605 Kyle Abraham (Thursday through Nov. 3) While working on his first commission for Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater (coming next month), this fast-rising choreographer has also been creating a new piece for his own company, Abraham.In.Motion.

This choreographer-playwright couple, now based in New York, founded their company in Israel 12 years ago; their elastic, off-kilter vocabulary owes much to the improvisational form known as Gaga, pioneered by the Israeli dance maker Ohad Naharin.

(Burke) \u2605 \u2018A Pluralistic View of the Judson Dance Theater Legacy\u2019 (Sunday) Judson Dance Theater is frequently remembered for its radical embrace of the ordinary \u2014 the \u201cno to spectacle\u201d mentality affirmed by Yvonne Rainer in her \u201cNo Manifesto.\u201d But there were also members of the 1960s collective, like Aileen Passloff, who relished a more full-bodied, less pedestrian kind of dancing. As part of \u201cMovement Research in Residence\u201d at the New Museum \u2014 one of this season\u2019s many programs honoring Judson\u2019s 50th anniversary \u2014 Wendy Perron will moderate a discussion in which Ms. Rainer and Ms. Passloff will talk about their divergent practices and the multifaceted legacy of Judson.

(Burke) \u2605 Yvonne Rainer (Thursday through Nov. 3) The simple act of running takes on mysterious depth in \u201cWe Shall Run,\u201d which Ms. Rainer, one of Judson Dance Theater\u2019s most outspoken iconoclasts, created in the heyday of that cultural movement. Performed by 12 students from Sarah Lawrence College, the 1963 work shares a program with two of her newer, more theatrical dances: \u201cAssisted Living: Good Sports 2\u201d and the premiere of \u201cAssisted Living: Do You Have Any Money?\u201d danced by her witty, sophisticated group, the Raindears. At 8 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark\u2019s Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, danspaceproject.org; $18. (Burke) \u2605 Malavika Sarukkai (Thursday through Nov. 3) Otherworldly, transcendent, divine: such are the words routinely used to describe Ms. Sarukkai, a preeminent dancer in the classical Indian style of Bharatanatyam. Writing in The New York Times about her Kennedy Center concert last year, Alastair Macaulay observed, \u201cYou feel that far larger things are passing through her, and that you are in communion with them, too.\u201d The Baryshnikov Arts Center and Lincoln Center\u2019s White Light Festival co-present her \u201cSpirit of the Body: Yatra \u2014 Seeking,\u201d a solo performance accompanied by live music. At 8:30 p.m., Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500, bacnyc.org; $25. (Burke) \u2605 \u2018Some Sweet Day\u2019 (Friday through Thursday; through Nov. 4) The guest curator Ralph Lemon has brought together three pairs of influential contemporary choreographers for this series at the Museum of Modern Art, revealing how their works converse across generational and geographical distances. (It also challenges them to make use of that museum\u2019s sprawling atrium.) Those artists are Steve Paxton and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bel; Dean Moss and Faustin Linyekula; and Sarah Michelson and Deborah Hay. They will participate in discussions of their work on Saturdays. (Mr. Moss and Mr. Linyekula will be featured this week, at 4 p.m.) A full schedule is at moma.org. Donald B. and Catherine C. Marron Atrium, Museum of Modern Art, moma.org, (212) 708-9400; $25, $18 for 65+ or $14 for students. (Burke) \u2605 Tanztheater Wuppertal (Friday and Saturday) What is there to say about Pina Bausch\u2019s final, beautiful work, \u201cComo el musguito en la piedra, ay si, si, si...\u201d except, go and see it? (The unwieldy title, which means \u201clike moss on a stone, ah yes, yes, yes,\u201d is taken from a song by the Chilean singer Violeta Parra.) Full of beautiful, winding solos, it celebrates the exceptional dancing of some of the younger members of the Wuppertal ensemble, as well as the gifts of some of its older dancers, like the 62-year-old Dominique Mercy. But then Bausch\u2019s work has never ignored the full spectrum of humanity, even \u2014 or particularly \u2014 its less agreeable aspects. \u201cComo el musguito,\u201d which was inspired by a residency in Chile, is, like much of her later work, markedly cheerful, even optimistic. In the light of her sudden death less than three weeks after its premiere, it seems all the more moving for that. At 7:30 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; sold out. (Roslyn Sulcas) Wave Rising Series (Friday through Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday; through Nov. 4) This three-week festival, presented by the choreographer Young Soon Kim at her company\u2019s theater in Dumbo, features 21 emerging artists from the United States, Canada and Korea.

The expulsion of Mr. Bo, who has been accused by the government of corruption and failure to disclose the murder by his wife of a British business executive, removes his immunity from prosecution. China\u2019s military is likely to remain well financed, even as the Chinese economy slows, analysts say. The new leaders are expected to push ahead with developing naval and air power that can rival the United States and with cyberwarfare capabilities, which the Chinese see as a new and effective way to project power. The new appointees will almost certainly become members of the Central Military Commission, a 12-member body that oversees the Chinese military and that is undergoing major changes as members reach mandatory retirement age. The jockeying for vacant positions has by all accounts been fierce, with much of it riding on personal allegiances to President Hu Jintao or Vice President Xi Jinping. Mr. Xi is expected to succeed Mr. Hu as Communist Party leader at the 18th Party Congress, scheduled to open on Nov. 8, and as president next year. The full slate of commission members will be unveiled at the Party Congress. Mr. Hu is chairman of the commission, and one of the big questions hovering over the Party Congress is whether he will yield this post to Mr. Xi, or hold onto it for two more years. Based on family connections and his own professional experience, Mr. Xi has stronger ties to the military than Mr. Hu, and analysts say that in many respects the military considers him one of their own. Whether that means Mr. Xi will rein in the military or give it greater scope as China asserts what it calls its territorial rights in the South China Sea and East China Sea over the next decade will be one of the most important strategic questions facing the country as it enters its new leadership phase, they say. Among those promoted was Gen. Ma Xiaotian, a former fighter pilot who will become head of the air force, a service that is now coming to the fore after long being relegated to a back seat. \u201cGeneral Ma is unusually outspoken,\u201d said Chas W. Freeman Jr., former assistant secretary of defense, who has met with Chinese military figures. \u201cHe does not yield easily to those with whom he disagrees, though he is willing to do so if an argument of sufficient logical force is presented. He is self-confident enough to really enjoy the rough-and-tumble of policy argument.\u201d In May, General Ma told a TV station based in Hong Kong that the South China Sea, where China is making increasing territorial claims, was \u201cnone of the United States\u2019 business.\u201d The Chinese Air Force is now \u201cseeking to create the kind of air power that can rival the U.S., and to create similar stealth, precision strike and long-range strike capabilities,\u201d said Anthony H. Cordesman, the senior military analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cIt is developing similar enablers in terms of refueling, electronic warfare systems, airborne command and control, and satellites.\u201d Earlier this year, General Ma accompanied China\u2019s defense minister, Liang Guanglie, on a visit to Washington. Gen. Zhang Youxia, who has publicly criticized the military for its lack of combat experience, was promoted to be director of the General Armament Department, which oversees procurement and research. General Zhang, one of the few senior commanders who does have battlefield experience, is said by Chinese military scholars to have been wounded during China\u2019s 1979 conflict with Vietnam. In 2009, he was quoted in People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, as saying: \u201cThe fires of war are burning throughout the world. In this area, the gap between the Chinese military and foreign militaries is growing by the day. This is a real problem.\u201d Before his promotion, he was commander of the Shenyang Military Region. The commander of the Beijing Military Region, Gen. Fang Fenghui, was promoted on Thursday to chief of the general staff, the Defense Ministry said. The former political commissar of the Guangzhou Military Region, Zhang Yang, was named director of the political department, and the former commander of the Nanjing Military Region, Gen. Zhao Keshi, was promoted to lead the logistics department. The new commission will almost certainly be overseeing China\u2019s development of cyberwarfare, an area that China views as particularly advantageous, and relatively inexpensive, said Kevin Pollpeter, China Project Manager for Defense Group Inc., a firm based in Washington that specializes in China\u2019s national security issues. \u201cCyber allows China projection ability it can\u2019t get with other weapons,\u201d Mr. Pollpeter said at a recent conference in Washington on China\u2019s military. So far, the Defense Ministry has not announced who will command the all-important Second Artillery Corps, home to the land-based ballistic and cruise missile units opposite Taiwan. Also yet to be announced is the new commander of the navy, another rapidly expanding branch of the military. The commanders of the Second Artillery Corps and the navy sit on the Central Military Commission. Two other posts \u2014 the commission\u2019s vice chairmen \u2014 also remain to be announced. These positions are filled by senior generals who run the day-to-day operations of the military under the civilian party leadership. Bree Feng contributed research.

For Halloween, she wants to dress up as Tippi Hedren in the Hitchcock movie \u201cThe Birds.\u201dHalloween is a small indulgence in a life that Ms. Paris, 41, said was consumed by worries \u2014 \u201cabout the kids, insurance, vacation, school, taxes, the price of gas, everything.\u201d She voted for Barack Obama in 2008 but is now torn. Mr. Obama has not lived up to his promise, she said. \u201cMy husband and I both have to work full time, and we\u2019re just getting by.\u201d But she is not thrilled with Mitt Romney either. She said he would set women back because he did not understand their needs. \u201cWomen worked so hard to get where we are today and to take our rights away from us is \u2014 no,\u201d she said, shaking her head. Behold the coveted female swing voter of 2012. She has slipped a rung or two down the economic ladder from the soccer moms of the more prosperous 1990s, as indicated by her new nickname \u2014 waitress mom. Rather than ferrying children around the suburbs in minivans, she is spinning in the hamster wheel of a tight economy and not getting ahead. The intense competition for the female vote was underscored Wednesday as both presidential campaigns seized on a remark by Richard E. Mourdock, the Republican Senate candidate in Indiana, in a Tuesday night debate that pregnancy is \u201csomething that God intended to happen\u201d even if it is the result of rape. Mr. Romney, who had just made an ad for Mr. Mourdock, quickly distanced himself from the statement, while the Obama campaign just as quickly suggested that it reflected the backward thinking of Republicans and said that if elected, they would pose a danger to women\u2019s health. The quadrennial obsession with winning over female voters can sometimes lead to mythmaking. Pollsters now question the validity of soccer moms as a distinct voting bloc; the term came into vogue in the 1996 presidential election but vanished soon after, to be replaced by the equally dubious post-9\/11 \u201csecurity moms.\u201d Whether or not the term \u201cwaitress moms\u201d endures, it defines a distinct demographic: blue-collar white women who did not attend college. And they are getting a lot of attention from both campaigns as the presidential race barrels toward its conclusion because even at this late date, pollsters say, many waitress moms have not settled on a candidate. They feel no loyalty to one party or the other, though they tend to side with Republicans. \u201cBlue-collar women are most likely to be the remaining movable part of the electorate, which is precisely why both campaigns are going at them as hard as they are,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, who is advising Priorities USA, a pro-Obama \u201csuper PAC.\u201d About 9 percent of all voters in 2008 were white women without college degrees who had an annual household income of less than $50,000, according to exit polls. So when the candidates talk about women, which they do a lot these days, the waitress moms are top of mind. Mr. Obama, for example, is now discussing abortion and birth control not as a matter of controlling one\u2019s own body but as \u201ca pocketbook issue for women and families,\u201d as he said in the recent town-hall-style debate, noting that many women rely on Planned Parenthood not just for contraceptives but for referrals and screenings. A recent Romney ad featured a young woman telling her newborn: \u201cDear Daughter. Welcome to America. Your share of Obama\u2019s debt is over $50,000.\u201d Clearly economic issues are front and center for women here in this blue-collar town in Rockingham County, which Mr. Obama won in 2008 by less than 1 percent of the vote. Michelle Trulson, 39, actually is a waitress (not all waitress moms are waitresses, of course, nor are they all mothers). She works a second job too, as a lab technician. Fearing that Mr. Romney would undercut her efforts to provide for her family \u2014 and end financing for Planned Parenthood \u2014 she supports Mr. Obama. \u201cI\u2019m a single mom,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not on welfare. I do work. I don\u2019t collect food stamps. But my kids need insurance, so they\u2019re on Medicaid and I don\u2019t want that messed with.\u201d 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/25\/opinion\/kristof-romneys-economic-plan.html","body":"Mitt Romney\u2019s best argument on the campaign trail has been simple: Under President Obama, the American economy has remained excruciatingly weak, far underperforming the White House\u2019s own projections.That\u2019s a fair criticism.

In the last few years, they\u2019ve repeatedly cited Republican-style austerity in places like Germany and Britain as a model for America. Let\u2019s dial back the time machine and listen up: \u201cEurope is already setting an example for the U.S.,\u201d Representative Kenny Marchant, a Texas Republican, said in 2010. (You know things are bad when a Texas Republican is calling for Americans to study at the feet of those socialist Europeans.) The same year, Karl Rove praised European austerity as a model for America and approvingly quoted the leader of the European Central Bank as saying: \u201cThe idea that austerity measures could trigger stagnation is incorrect.\u201d Representative Steve King of Iowa, another Republican, praised Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany for preaching austerity and said: \u201cIt ought to hit home to our president of the United States. It ought to hit all of us here in this country.\u201d \u201cThe president should learn a lesson from the \u2018German Miracle,\u2019 \u201d Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina, a Republican, urged on the House floor in July 2011. Also in 2011, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, denounced Obama\u2019s economic management and said: \u201cWe need a budget with a bold vision \u2014 like those unveiled in Britain and New Jersey.\u201d O.K. Let\u2019s see how that\u2019s working out. New Jersey isn\u2019t overseas, but since Sessions and many other Republicans have hailed it as a shining model of austerity, let\u2019s start there. New Jersey ranked 47th in economic growth last year. When Gov. Chris Christie took office in 2010 and began to impose austerity measures, New Jersey ranked 35th in its unemployment rate; now it ranks 48th. Senator Sessions, do we really aspire for the same in America as a whole? Something similar has happened internationally. The International Monetary Fund this month downgraded its estimates for global economic growth, with only one major bright spot in the West. That would be the United States, expected to grow a bit more than 2 percent this year and next. In contrast, Europe\u2019s economy is expected to shrink this year and have negligible growth next year. The I.M.F. projects that Germany will grow less than 1 percent this year and next, while Britain\u2019s economy is contracting this year. Karl Rove, that sounds a lot like stagnation to me. All this is exactly what economic textbooks predicted. Since Keynes, it\u2019s been understood that, in a downturn, governments should go into deficit to stimulate demand; that\u2019s how we got out of the Great Depression. And recent European data and I.M.F. analyses underscore that austerity in the middle of a downturn not only doesn\u2019t help but leads to even higher ratios of debt to economic output. So, yes, Republicans have a legitimate point about the long-term need to curb deficits and entitlement growth. But, no, it isn\u2019t reasonable for Republicans to advocate austerity in the middle of a downturn. On that, they\u2019re empirically wrong. If there were still doubt about this, we\u2019ve had a lovely natural experiment in the last few years, as the Republicans in previous years were happy to point out. All industrialized countries experienced similar slowdowns, and the United States under Obama chose a massive stimulus while Germany and Britain chose Republican-endorsed austerity. Neither approach worked brilliantly. Obama\u2019s initial economic stimulus created at least 1.4 million jobs, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. But that wasn\u2019t enough, and it was partly negated by austerity in state and local governments. Still, America\u2019s economy is now the fastest growing among major countries in the West, and Britain\u2019s is shrinking. Which would you prefer? I\u2019m not suggesting Obama distribute bumper stickers saying: \u201cIt Could Be Worse.\u201d He might want to stick with: \u201cOsama\u2019s Dead and G.M. Is Alive.\u201d Yes, there are differences between Europe and America. But Republicans were right to call attention to this empirical experiment. The results are in. And, as Representative King suggested, the lessons \u201cought to hit all of us here in this country.\u201d \u2022 I invite you to visit my blog, On the Ground.

The deal still requires passage by the Greek Parliament, where it is certain to test the viability of the country\u2019s shaky governing coalition. The finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, also said Wednesday that Greece\u2019s European partners had agreed to give Athens additional time to carry out the austerity program \u2014 about 13.5 billion euros ($17.5 billion) of spending cuts and tax increases \u2014 instead of adopting it all immediately. The point would be to soften the blow to Greece\u2019s moribund economy, which is heading for its sixth consecutive year of recession. But Simon O\u2019Connor, spokesman for the European economic affairs commissioner, Olli Rehn, rebuffed reports that an extended timetable had yet been agreed to. The austerity package, months in the making, has fueled sometimes violent street protests by Greeks who are facing their third round of belt-tightening in three years. And getting the three-party coalition of the prime minister, Antonis Samaras, to approve the package remains an uphill battle. Mr. Samaras has warned members of his own New Democracy Party to approve the package or face being ousted. But some members of the coalition\u2019s junior partners \u2014 the Democratic Left and the socialist Pasok parties \u2014 are refusing to support wage and pension cuts, although they have pledged not to jeopardize Greece\u2019s access to more financial aid. Passage would require 151 of the Parliament\u2019s total 300 votes. The leader of the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party, which has ridden a tide of anger against immigrants and Greece\u2019s worsening economy, recently threatened to have the party\u2019s 18 parliamentary members resign when a vote is held, a move that, if carried out, could delay its passage. The measures need to be approved by Greek lawmakers before Nov. 12. That is when finance ministers from euro zone countries, scheduled to meet in Brussels, are expected to consider whether Greece should get its new tranche of aid. Should the measures pass, Greece\u2019s so-called troika of lenders \u2014 the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission \u2014 would issue a report gauging whether Greece has made sufficient progress in mending its tattered finances to receive the 31.5 billion euros in aid that Mr. Stournaras has said is needed for Greece to avoid bankruptcy. With state coffers virtually empty, an economy near depression and unemployment at a record high of 25 percent, Greece is counting on the money to keep the government running. It also needs to pay off a portion of more than 8 billion euros in arrears that it owes suppliers for basic products, like medicines, that some companies have stopped supplying to Greece until they are paid. And yet most of the money would not be put directly back into the economy. Instead, about 85 percent of the loan installment would go to replenishing the capital reserves of Greece\u2019s shaky banking system. Those cushions were depleted early this year after the banks lost huge amounts of money, when the government forced its creditors to take a 50 percent loss on the Greek bonds \u2014 held in large part by Greece\u2019s banks. Mr. Samaras, the prime minister, has said the money will enable banks to start lending again, fueling growth at a time when the government estimates that the economy will contract by 6.5 percent this year. But many Greeks are concerned that the banks would simply hold onto the money rather than lend to businesses, continuing a trend that has already led tens of thousands of small and medium-size enterprises to fold in the last several years. \u201cI\u2019m not confident that there will be a large portion of funds going into the market,\u201d said Constantine Mihalos, president of the Athens Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThe vast majority of the funds will be filling gaps\u201d in the banks\u2019 accounts, he added, so \u201cthe liquidity crunch that has resulted in the death of even healthy companies will go on.\u201d A draft version of the deal, leaked to the media late Tuesday, included cutbacks in the public sector, where 5,000 civil servants would be placed on reduced wages this year before being either transferred to other jobs or dismissed. The same would happen to another 20,000 in 2013. The retirement age would increase by two years, to 67 from 65, while certain categories of civil servants on \u201cspecial salaries\u201d would see their wages cut by as much as 35 percent. The draft package also foresees a reduction in the number of associate professors at state universities from 15,226 to 2,000 and an end to the majority of tax exemptions. An emergency \u201csolidarity\u201d tax on income would be extended until 2018. Mr. Stournaras, the finance minister, told Parliament on Wednesday that Greece aimed to reduce its debt burden by lowering the interest rate on the rescue loans it receives from the troika and extending the payback periods of those loans.

The purchasing managers\u2019 index published by the British bank HSBC rallied to 49.1 points in October \u2014 a marked improvement from the 47.9 recorded for September and the firmest result in three months. Closely watched by analysts, the preliminary reading of the HSBC index provides one of the earliest insights into how the Chinese economy is faring each month. A final version of the October figure is set to be published Nov. 1, when a separate measure compiled by the Chinese authorities is also due for release. Analysts said the improvement in the October reading reflected the effect of a steady drip of stimulus measures introduced by Beijing. A gradual improvement in overseas demand in recent months also has helped. A subindex measuring new export orders, for example, rose to a five-month high of 47.3 points as orders for the Christmas season came in. The reading provided a \u201cpositive sign,\u201d and \u201cfurther evidence of a pickup for the fourth quarter,\u201d economists at Australia & New Zealand Bank in Hong Kong wrote in a research note. At the same time, however, the October number was still below 50 points \u2014 the level that separates expansion from contraction, showing that the companies polled in the survey still faced considerable challenges. Lackluster overseas demand for Chinese exports and moves last year by Beijing to dampen the rapid pace of growth and cool inflation and a red-hot property market have slowed down the Chinese economy this year. The health of the important property sector, in particular, continues to worry some analysts. They fear that many developments that were rushed out when the Chinese authorities engineered a major stimulus program in late 2008 and 2009 may ultimately go sour. Reflecting a widespread recognition that future economic expansion is likely to be much more subdued than in the past, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank both lowered their economic growth forecasts for China this month. The I.M.F., for example, said it expected the Chinese economy to expand by 7.8 percent this year \u2014 a pace that easily outpaces the United States or Europe, but falls short of China\u2019s 9.3 percent expansion in 2011, and its 10.4 percent growth rate in 2010. For next year, the I.M.F. forecasts 8.2 percent growth in gross domestic product \u2014 in other words, a slight pickup from this year, but no return to the double-digit growth rates of the years before the global financial crisis. Economic data for September, and the HSBC index for October, underlined that view, showing that the pace of growth appeared to have stabilized and could pick up in the coming months. Thanks to a series of recent measures to bolster the economy, in the fourth quarter of this year, \u201cgrowth has likely bottomed out and is headed for a gradual recovery,\u201d Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at HSBC, wrote. Over the past year, the authorities have loosened lending constraints for banks in a bid to encourage more loans and have stepped up infrastructure project approvals. Two small interest rate cuts in June and July also aimed to improve growth. The ongoing financial turmoil in Europe and the risks associated with the looming \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d in the United States, however, mean that the outlook remains \u201cchallenging,\u201d Mr. Qu said. Released Wednesday, a purchasing managers\u2019 index for manufacturing and services businesses in the euro zone, compiled by Markit, an economic data firm, underlined his point: The preliminary reading for October fell to a 40-month low of 45.8 points, from 46.1 in September, confounding expectations for a slight rise."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/25\/business\/economy\/fed-affirms-low-rates-and-sees-moderate-growth.html","body":"WASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it would continue its economic stimulus campaign, aimed at reducing unemployment, amid fresh evidence of a housing recovery that could help to bolster those efforts.Sales of new homes rose 5.7 percent in September to the highest level since 2010, when the government was offering tax credits to first-time buyers, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. The report joins other recent data showing rising prices and increased construction in affirming that the housing market is recovering from its prolonged downturn. The Fed acknowledged that consumer spending, including spending on housing, has strengthened, but it said that it remained convinced that its efforts were necessary to bolster an inconsistent and lackluster recovery. Unemployment remains stubbornly high, the domestic economy is growing slowly, the global economy is struggling and a so-called fiscal cliff looms at the end of the year. \u201cThe committee is concerned that, without further policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions,\u201d the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee said in a statement released after a regularly scheduled two-day meeting. This was the Fed\u2019s last meeting before the presidential election. In holding its course, the Fed again defied the criticism of the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, who has described the central bank\u2019s efforts as ineffective and inflationary and who has promised to replace its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. Indeed, the statement from the policy unit, the Federal Open Market Committee, once again emphasized that it remained prepared to expand its efforts \u201cif the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially.\u201d The decision was supported by 11 members of the committee. The only opposition came from Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, who has dissented at each meeting this year. The Fed announced after its last meeting, in September, that it would buy $40 billion in mortgage securities each month until the jobs outlook improved, a significant expansion of its stimulus campaign. It also said it intended to keep short-term interest rates near zero at least until mid-2015. The new policy is aimed specifically at helping the housing market by reducing interest rates on mortgage loans. The more people who buy homes, the greater the benefit to the housing market and to the economy in general. The housing market remains depressed by historical standards. New home sales have reached an annual pace of 389,000, better than the last two years but significantly worse than any other year since 1963. And housing remains anchored to employment. People need jobs to buy homes. \u201cAll the housing data has taken a turn for the better. Clearly, mortgage rates at such a low level and what appears to be an increase in banks\u2019 willingness to make loans has boosted activity off the lows,\u201d Steven Richiutto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities, wrote in a note to clients. \u201cBut I would still not read too much into this unless employment picks up. We have seen false starts before.\u201d The Fed\u2019s next meeting, scheduled for Dec. 11 and 12, will be more consequential. Under a separate program begun last year, the Fed also is buying about $45 billion in long-term Treasury securities each month. Those purchases are scheduled to end in December. Officials have said they will consider extending the program depending on the condition of the economy. The central bank appears determined to press its campaign until it is certain of the results, so long as inflation remains under control. It has been chastened by a series of misjudgments, after declaring several times in recent years that the recovery was gaining strength only to conclude that more stimulus was needed. William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech this month that, as a consequence, the Fed had not done enough to support the economic recovery. \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight,\u201d he said, \u201cmonetary policy needed to be still more aggressive.\u201d A number of Fed officials also argue that the current policy would be more effective if the Fed defined a clear target for its efforts, like a level of unemployment or economic output. But consensus about the right target so far has proved elusive."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/25\/opinion\/put-demand-behind-the-wheel.html","body":"Have economists in Europe learned nothing about the importance of stimulating demand?

The 25-year deal still requires approval by the National Hockey League and would essentially double the number of professional sports games at the $1 billion arena each year. The arena is already home to the Brooklyn Nets, which relocated from New Jersey and is scheduled to host its first regular-season game next week. Along with an already rich slate of concerts and other events, including recent sold-out appearances by Jay-Z and Barbra Streisand, this suddenly flush calendar has accentuated fears of those in the surrounding brownstone neighborhoods that the community could be overwhelmed. Though other developers of sports sites have watched the \u201cif you build it they will come\u201d approach end in disappointment, the Barclays Center suddenly finds itself one of nine arenas nationwide that showcases teams from both the National Basketball Association and the N.H.L. One of the other arenas, of course, is Madison Square Garden, home to the rival Knicks and Rangers, which means New York City will soon have six major professional teams across four boroughs. \u201cNot long ago, I think it\u2019s fair to say the idea of a big league sports team coming to Brooklyn was considered little more than a pipe dream,\u201d Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a news conference, flanked by Charles B. Wang, the Islanders owner; Bruce C. Ratner, the developer of the Barclays Center; and Gary Bettman, the N.H.L. commissioner, among others. The team vowed not to change its name, keeping \u201cNew York\u201d in place of the trendy \u201cBrooklyn\u201d label. But the symbolism of its move from the suburbs to the heart of the city\u2019s largest borough was underscored by the apparent need to update the team logo, which features the outline of nearly all of Long Island, but cuts off Brooklyn and Queens. Mr. Ratner, who still owns a majority stake in the arena, started meeting with Mr. Wang six or seven years ago, usually in the team owner\u2019s favorite Chinese restaurant, the Orient, in Bethpage. The talks picked up in earnest several months ago, but Mr. Wang, who attended Brooklyn Technical High School, did not make up his mind until he saw the arena. Mr. Ratner predicted that the heavy dose of sports, especially in winter, would not crowd out entertainment events like the recent concerts. \u201cLike Carnegie Hall,\u201d he said, \u201cit will be a place where there\u2019s great stuff always.\u201d Details of the deal were not made public, but people involved in the talks said there were no financial incentives involved, nor any involvement from the city government. A preliminary analysis by the city\u2019s Economic Development Corporation did estimate, however, that the Islanders deal could generate $175 million in economic activity each season. For years now, Mr. Wang has been eager to upgrade or replace the team\u2019s aging home, which opened in 1972, and is now one of the older arenas in professional hockey. Last August, Nassau County voters, who pay among the highest local taxes in the nation, soundly defeated a contentious proposal to spend $400 million to overhaul the arena. The team publicly toyed with moving to another city with a modern arena, including Quebec City, Kansas City and Seattle. The Islanders\u2019 current lease requires them to play at Nassau Coliseum through the 2014-15 season, and Mr. Wang said at a news conference that the team would honor that agreement. For a glorious stretch, the Islanders rose quickly from cellar-dweller to powerhouse, and dwarfed their bitter rivals, the Rangers, whose Stanley Cup drought \u2014 which eventually ended in 1994 \u2014 was hockey\u2019s answer to the World Series-challenged Red Sox or Cubs. Led by Hall of Famers like Mike Bossy, Bryan Trottier and Denis Potvin, they won four straight Stanley Cups from 1980 to 1983 and reached the 1984 Cup final, a run that encompassed 19 consecutive series victories, still a league record. Then came a long, steady decline. Attendance plummeted. Even the front office became an embarrassment: one owner, John Spano, was convicted of fraud, because it turned out he did not have enough money to buy the team. On Wednesday, some Nassau officials seemed caught off guard by the Islanders\u2019 departure, setting off a round of sniping between political opponents. \u201cThis is a sad day for Nassau County and unfortunately another crippling hit to our local economy,\u201d Kevan Abrahams, the county\u2019s Democratic leader, said in a statement. \u201cTo lose the Islanders, Nassau\u2019s only professional sports franchise, is an epic failure of leadership at all levels.\u201d 1 2 Next Page \u00bb Reporting was contributed by Charles V.

The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has lost 3.6 percent over the last five sessions, hurt by weak earnings outlooks and revenue shortfalls from large multinational companies. The index is now down 3.9 percent from its closing high of 1,465.77 set on Sept. 14. Boeing, the aerospace and defense company, bucked the trend with a more optimistic outlook, but it could not break away from the rest of the market as it was pulled into negative territory in the afternoon.

It also raised its earnings forecast for 2012 for the third time.The company, based in Chicago, increased deliveries of both commercial and military airplanes, with the biggest revenue gains coming from the growing demand for new passenger planes. Boeing\u2019s chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., said advances in technology were helping the company\u2019s jetliner sales surge despite the lackluster economy. He said airlines and leasing companies were moving to replace older planes more quickly than normal to gain fuel savings from new engines and parts made from lightweight composite materials. Boeing\u2019s military business also remained steady, and other large military contractors reported solid operating results despite a push to tighten defense budgets. Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, which are both mainly military companies, also beat analyst expectations on Wednesday in reporting third-quarter profits. Over all, Boeing\u2019s third-quarter sales increased by 13 percent to $20 billion from $17.7 billion a year earlier. Its net income dropped, as expected, because of higher pension expenses, but still exceeded analyst expectations. Third-quarter net income totaled $1.03 billion, or $1.35 a share. That was 6 percent less than the $1.1 billion, or $1.46 a share, that Boeing reported a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected $1.12 a share. Boeing said growing sales of its older 737 and 777 commercial models, as well as increasing deliveries of the new 787 and 747-8 jets, should help it earn $4.80 to $4.95 a share for all of 2012. It previously had forecast earnings of $4.40 to $4.60 a share for 2012. About a year ago, Boeing began deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner, the first passenger jet to make substantial use of the composites, and the 747-8, an enlarged version of the classic 747. Both models were late and over budget. But Boeing is shipping 70 to 85 of the new planes to customers this year, and Robert Stallard, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote to clients on Wednesday that the company was \u201cgetting pretty good\u201d at completing \u201ctrouble-free\u201d quarters. Boeing said it remained on track to deliver 585 to 600 commercial planes this year, which could enable it to reclaim the top spot in worldwide aircraft sales. Europe\u2019s Airbus, which passed Boeing in deliveries in 2003, has projected that it will supply 570 planes to customers in 2012. Boeing has already started to update its best-selling 737 single-aisle planes, and Mr. McNerney said the company was now considering replacing the metal wings on the larger 777s with the lightweight composites and switching to more fuel-efficient engines on that model. He said that even with just those changes, rather than a complete redesign, Boeing could deliver cost savings on the 777 that are \u201cpretty eye-watering.\u201d He said the company was still considering the options, but expected to start delivering a new version of the 777 by the early 2020s. In terms of military business, both Boeing and Lockheed, the largest military contractor, said they had increased sales overseas to offset some of the reductions at the Pentagon. Lockheed said Wednesday that its net earnings from continuing operations increased in the third quarter to $727 million, or $2.21 a share, from $665 million, or $1.99 a share, a year earlier. Its sales were $11.9 billion compared with $12.1 billion a year earlier. Lockheed said it expected its sales to decline at a low single-digit rate in 2013. But it also expects its profit margins to remain above 11 percent as long as Congress can stave off sequestration, the plan to force large automatic spending cuts at the Pentagon. Both President Obama and his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, have promised that they would stop the cuts if they win the November election. Northrop Grumman\u2019s earnings also beat analyst expectations, though its quarterly profit fell 12 percent from last year\u2019s levels on a drop in net pension income. General Dynamics, another large arms company, missed the analyst consensus on its earnings. Its profits fell by 8 percent, partly because of a $25 million charge to revalue inventory."}][{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/25\/business\/global\/europes-central-bank-chief-to-face-german-lawmakers.html","body":"BERLIN \u2014 The head of the European Central Bank, aiming to build trust with German lawmakers critical of the bank\u2019s recently announced bond-buying program, spent two hours Wednesday reassuring members of Parliament that the plan dovetailed with wider reform efforts within the euro zone.Lawmakers from across Germany\u2019s political spectrum welcomed the gesture by the E.C.B. president, Mario Draghi, to consider their concerns that the program could trigger inflation and undermine efforts to push through reforms in the weaker euro zone countries. \u201cI had the impression that this discussion achieved a lot to better understand the intent and concerns from both sides,\u201d said Norbert Lammert, president of the Parliament, the Bundestag. Many other members apparently welcomed Mr. Draghi\u2019s visit and the chance to pose questions directly to him, although some opposition lawmakers maintained criticism that the E.C.B. plan amounted to a first step on a path toward common sharing of debt among the 17 states using the euro. Mr. Draghi met with about 150 lawmakers, mostly members of the finance, budgetary and European affairs committees, rather than the full assembly. It would have been considered inappropriate for him to address the full Bundestag, an honor reserved for heads of state or dignitaries like the pope. In his opening remarks, Mr. Draghi addressed the criticisms point by point, telling lawmakers that the bond-buying program would not lead to disguised financing of governments, compromise the bank\u2019s independence, nor create excessive risks for taxpayers nor lead to inflation. Mr. Draghi already had the backing of Chancellor Angela Merkel and her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, but many lawmakers who had remained unsure about the program expressed approval of the thoroughness and detail that Mr. Draghi drew from to explain the bank\u2019s decisions. \u201cHis answers were very convincing, and we can therefore give the message to German citizens that fears of inflation that have been expressed here and there are unfounded,\u201d said Norbert Barthle, a senior member of the chancellor\u2019s party. Even though the plan, known as Outright Monetary Transactions, or O.M.T., has not yet been implemented, its existence has already contributed to an easing of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone by pushing down the borrowing costs of fragile countries like Spain. The lawmakers had sought reassurances about the conditions under which it would be run, and Mr. Draghi explained that by linking it to receiving nations implementing reforms, its goal remained in step with overall efforts to restructure the economies of weaker euro zone members. Emerging from the closed-door session, Mr. Draghi said he had welcomed the tough questioning. \u201cThese opportunities make you think, but also express your views in a way that can be understood by nonspecialists,\u201d he said, \u201cby people who don\u2019t do this 24 hours a day, every day of their lives.\u201d An appearance by the E.C.B. president before members of the Bundestag is not unique. Mr. Draghi\u2019s predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, briefed German lawmakers in April 2010 on the details of the first financial bailout for Greece, along with Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then head of the International Monetary Fund. But such meetings are rare, and Wednesday\u2019s reflected how important Mr. Draghi, a former head of the Bank of Italy, views keeping German lawmakers on his side. Among the fiercest critics of his plan has been Jens Weidmann, the president of Germany\u2019s central bank. He was the only one of 23 members of the E.C.B.\u2019s Governing Council to oppose the plan, arguing that it would violate a ban on using the central bank to finance governments. Michael Meister, a member of the chancellor\u2019s conservative Christian Democratic party, echoed those concerns in telling Rheinische Post on Wednesday that he expected Mr. Draghi to voice \u201cclear support for monetary stability and clear rejection of E.C.B. intervention in financing governments.\u201d Mr. Draghi has defended the bond-buying program by saying that taking no action would have posed a greater danger. He has insisted that the plan is fully within the bank\u2019s mandate to ensure price stability in the euro zone. Since announcement of the plan on Sept. 6, talk of the euro zone\u2019s breaking apart has quieted and investors have brought down interest rates on loans to Spain and Italy. Experts acknowledge the benefits brought about by the program, but warn that without the necessary structural changes to the economies of the weaker euro zone members, there can be no lasting recovery and that inflation remains a threat. German worries about the economy are not unfounded. Germany\u2019s business community\u2019s confidence fell in October for the sixth straight month, a survey by the Ifo institute in Munich showed Wednesday. The survey of 7,000 executives dropped to 100.0 from 101.4, despite forecasts that it would rise, reflecting that uncertainties stemming from the sovereign debt crisis, now in its third year."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/25\/business\/smallbusiness\/at-pizzerias-an-owner-learned-the-importance-of-accounting.html","body":"Pizza shop owners rarely are celebrated for their innovative company cultures, but Nick Sarillo is an exception. His use of open-book management, his efforts to help community groups raise money and his development of what he calls a trust-and-track management style have spawned a cover article in Inc. magazine and his own recently published book, \u201cA Slice of the Pie: How to Build a Big Little Business.\u201dA second-generation pizza entrepreneur \u2014 his father owned a pizzeria in Carpentersville, Ill. \u2014 Mr. Sarillo, 50, opened his first Nick\u2019s Pizza & Pub in Crystal Lake, Ill., in 1995 and his second in 2005 in Elgin, a nearby suburb of Chicago. Annual revenues rose to $7 million in 2007. But while he was sharp on culture, Mr. Sarillo acknowledges he was na\u00efve about numbers. He overborrowed and overbuilt when times were good, then almost lost his business when the economy turned. Only an impassioned online plea to his customers saved Nick\u2019s. \u201cBarring some sort of miracle, we are going to run out of cash to pay our vendors and team members over the next couple of weeks and will have to close,\u201d he wrote in a September 2011 e-mail sent to customers and later posted on the company Web site. The following conversation has been edited and condensed. Q. What was your father\u2019s pizza joint like? A. It was good when my dad was there to tell people what to do. He was a good guy, but he didn\u2019t coach much. He just said, \u201cGet this done now.\u201d When he wasn\u2019t around, it was slack. He always taught me you can never have more than one restaurant because no one cares. Other entrepreneurs were telling me the same thing. But I realized that was because of the culture they created in their businesses. That\u2019s where I said I\u2019ll do something different. Q. You describe your management style as trust and track. What does that mean? A. Especially with a younger generation like we have at this restaurant, they\u2019re going to be more motivated and more productive if the managers are more like coaches. Instead of being told what to do, they want to be supported and coached. This trust-and-track model is about giving the team the tools they need, telling them the result we need and trusting them to get there in their own way. At the same time, you have to track the results. Q. Tell me about your community involvement. A. As in many companies, I used to write checks and donate \u2014 because I\u2019m a good guy and I care. But there wasn\u2019t much awareness in the employees or community about why I was doing that. Then we came up with our fund-raising system. Instead of an advertising budget like most companies \u2014 say 3 percent of sales \u2014 we have zero dollars in our advertising budget and give back 5 percent of our net sales to our community through fund-raising. We do that by allowing organizations, the ones I used to write checks to, to come in and use our building to raise money. Q. And then you started having problems in the Elgin restaurant? A. When I built my first restaurant in Crystal Lake, it was only 150 seats and about 3,500 square feet. I could have done the same thing in Elgin. But like many entrepreneurs, I have that eternal optimism. The Elgin restaurant is just over 9,000 square feet, with 350 seats. It was a $5 million project with property and building. I overbuilt the restaurant based on the projections that there would be 80,000 people moving into housing development projects there. None of the developments got built. Q. What happened? A. Unemployment got really high in our areas, over 10 percent. So the families didn\u2019t have money to go out. Sales dropped a little in 2009 and 2010. We did some great promotions where we were giving back, a couple days a week with half-price pizzas for people out of work. Those kinds of things helped us maintain a healthy level of sales to get by. We weren\u2019t building any cash, but we were making it. Q. When did you realize that you weren\u2019t making it? A. Sometime in the beginning of 2011 I asked an adviser for some help, and he schooled me on debt-to-asset ratios on my balance sheet and basically gave me what I would call a come-to-Jesus speech. Q. What exactly had you missed? A. I wasn\u2019t watching how the liabilities side of my balance sheet was growing. I was incurring more and more debt, and our debt-to-equity ratio was getting way out of whack. A healthy ratio is one to one, but ours was more than three to one. I had millions in debt. I had the $5 million project. And the asset values were decreasing as the property values were going down. That\u2019s the downside of having so much success. I got a little complacent about taking on debt. Q. Given your balance sheet problems, how were you able to get bank loans? A. When I first got approved for the bank loans, our sales and everything was climbing and improving, and the values of our properties were real high. The bank probably didn\u2019t look as close as they should have as well. And they gave us a line of credit that they probably shouldn\u2019t have. Q. By September 2011, things were really bad and you wrote the letter to your customers saying you were about to go broke. How much did it help? A. I still have that sales report on my wall because it was so amazing. The Elgin restaurant in the first week had an increase of 105 percent and Crystal Lake had an increase of 110 percent. The second week and third week were close to that. They were like 90 percent. And then maybe 85 percent the third week. It was five weeks before sales settled back down again, but not all the way down. Q. This must have taken a toll on you personally. A. I\u2019ve never been in this kind of situation. I\u2019ve always made my payments, ever since I was 16 years old. So the responsibility at a personal level weighed heavily on me. So much so that \u2014 while I\u2019m very athletic, I work out, I swim a lot \u2014 at the end of this, right around Labor Day, my back tightened up. I\u2019d blown two discs in my back. I totally believe that had something to do with the stress I was holding. Q. Did the letter get you out of the hole? A. We got current with all our vendors. We made payroll. We paid our mortgage for that month. But also the bank worked with us on our loan. They deferred our principal for one year. Q. Are you paying the principal now? A. Yes. We just started. Q. Can you keep both restaurants open? A. Yes, we can, as things are now. It\u2019s still not easy. Q. What does your father say? A. He\u2019s a proponent of selling the restaurant company and starting over. He thinks I work too hard for not much pay, just to get things turned around. A lot of business owners would claim bankruptcy and get out of this and start over again. He\u2019s concerned about the stress. Q. Do you still plan to open more Nick\u2019s Pizza & Pub stores? A. Yeah, I would for sure. What we do in our communities and how we run our business is really amazing, and I would love to bring this to other communities. But it\u2019s not going to happen anytime soon.

It warned that its third-quarter numbers would be a pre-Halloween horror, and so investors naturally started thinking about the apocalypse. The results, released after the market closed Wednesday, were not quite as bad as that. In addition, the company announced a partnership to offer online casino games in Britain where gamblers can wager real money. Such games, which have been banned in the United States, are promoted as highly profitable. Third-quarter revenue was $317 million, an improvement over the $300 million to $305 million the company forecast in early October when it warned that tough times were ahead. The number was also significantly higher than the $256 million that downbeat analysts had expected. But revenue was only 3 percent better than 2011. Still, the stock immediately spiked, rising as much as 30 cents in after-hours trading to $2.42. Zynga shares are down 75 percent from their public offering price last December, and have dropped even more from the level at which executives and early investors cashed out last spring in an unusual $500 million secondary offering. \u201cIn less than 10 months, Zynga has gone from a massive global growth story to a cost-cutting restructuring story,\u201d said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research. \u201cHow did the rug get pulled out from under them so fast? It still amazes us.\u201d Mr. Greenfield pointed to a new Zynga game, the Ville, in which players create the home of their dreams. In an economy in which hardly anyone can afford to do this in real life, Zynga had high hopes some players would spend money to do it virtually. The Ville was introduced in June and had 7.3 million daily users at the end of July. Today: 1.7 million. \u201cThe decay curve, the half-life, is shortening,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said. \u201cIt\u2019s staggering how fast some of these games have fallen off.\u201d For all the downward trend, Zynga is still the most popular social gaming company. It is controlled by its founder and chief executive, Mark Pincus, who now has the opportunity to prove he is worth the fortune Zynga has showered on him. \u201cIs Zynga doomed?\u201d asked Joost van Dreunen of SuperData Research. \u201cNo. Not yet. But the next play they make is going to be Pincus\u2019 most important bet to date.\u201d Silicon Valley loves to worry about whether it is in a bubble; merely asking the question is proof that it is not true. But for a small group of companies, the bubble has already burst. Groupon, Netflix and, most visibly, Facebook have all been hammered recently as investors began to realign their rosy expectations with cruel reality. Zynga is by far the most embattled of this select group. Even as its partner Facebook staged a tentative revival Wednesday \u2014 Facebook shares rose 19 percent on the heels of better-than-expected third-quarter numbers \u2014 Zynga\u2019s own earnings report raised the question of its long-term viability. \u201cThe last several months have obviously been challenging for us,\u201d Mr. Pincus said in a conference call with analysts. The company lost 7 cents a share last quarter; in 2011, it broke even. As part of its reorganization, the company announced a $200 million share buyback plan. Zynga began cutbacks this week. It is dismissing 5 percent of its 3,000 employees and turning off 13 games. It is also withdrawing support from the Ville. All that is unlikely to be enough, said Arvind Bhatia, an analyst at Sterne Agee. \u201cThe Zynga model was flaky to begin with,\u201d Mr. Bhatia said, noting the dependence on Facebook, on a few hit games like FarmVille and CityVille, and on just a few players who were willing to buy virtual tractors to speed their play. \u201cIf they could find a hit, maybe things could turn around. But the recent track record doesn\u2019t give you a lot of confidence.\u201d When Zynga went public in December, the caution of a few skeptics, including Mr. Bhatia, was drowned out by the enthusiasm for getting in on the hot social network scene before shares in Facebook itself were available. Zynga had a compelling story to offer: In a world starved for time, we would keep in touch with our friends by playing games with them during snatched moments. \u201cI fundamentally believe that the biggest opportunity is to get people like me to play,\u201d Mr. Pincus said in an interview with Games Industry International. \u201cI\u2019m a latent gamer; it\u2019s there, it\u2019s just in the background because I\u2019m too busy, and I can\u2019t find the time, I can\u2019t justify the time. But if you could get it in front of me and you could distill it down to something that I could get into in five minutes, and I could play it with friends and other people, you would have me.\u201d After its debut at $10 a share, Zynga was valued at $7 billion. Early investors and company officials, including Mr. Pincus, sold a few months later at $12 a share. In that era, Zynga and Facebook were closely tied. But on Facebook\u2019s earnings call Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg distanced his company from Zynga, saying even as revenue from Zynga was down 20 percent annualized, revenue from other gaming companies was up 40 percent. Translation: a sinking Zynga won\u2019t hurt Facebook. As a headline in the TheStreet.com put it: \u201cCall the Cops, Mark Zuckerberg Just Killed Zynga.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/25\/sports\/hockey\/since-wang-vowed-to-halt-fall-islanders-have-kept-sinking.html","body":"For many Islanders fans, the good old days are painfully difficult to remember not because they were not good but because the team that won four straight Stanley Cups in the 1980s has morphed into a derelict franchise that has alienated all but its most die-hard followers.Since those glory years, the Islanders have lurched from one troubled owner to another. A carousel of general managers has fired a parade of coaches. Players have skated in front of fewer and fewer fans, some of whom have sat with umbrellas open because of Nassau Coliseum\u2019s leaky roof. In 2000, Charles B. Wang and Sanjay Kumar bought the team and vowed to halt the long fall and to revitalize what was once considered a model franchise with stable management and devoted players. Proud immigrants whose company, Computer Associates, was based on Long Island, they wanted to give back to the community by saving the team. Although they were hockey neophytes who read \u201cHockey for Dummies,\u201d co-written by John Davidson, a former Rangers goaltender, they were realistic. \u201cLet\u2019s face it: the Coliseum is a dump, and the team, well, they\u2019re losers,\u201d Wang said at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s a real shame. We want to see it change because this is our home. We all deserve better.\u201d The team ultimately did not change, or at least not enough. On Wang\u2019s watch, the Islanders have made the postseason four times and have not won a series. Attendance perked up for a few years when Wang spent freely but dwindled after he slashed payroll to offset growing losses. He has gone without a team president, and the Islanders switched from their flagship radio station to one run by Hofstra University. Fans, tired of watching games in a drafty, 40-year-old arena, have stayed away. The Islanders averaged 13,191 fans a game last season, second worst in the league and just ahead of the Phoenix Coyotes. Like his predecessors, Wang fought hard to get a new arena that might generate the extra revenue needed to sign better players and reel in big sponsors and free-spending fans. He also tried to get out from under a lopsided deal with SMG, the company that runs the Coliseum on behalf of Nassau County. Like his predecessors, Wang has fought a losing battle. In 2004, he proposed a grand plan to refurbish the Coliseum and build apartments, stores and an office tower nearby. The project turned into a political football as Democrats and Republicans opposed and supported it. When that failed, a far slimmer plan was sent last year to voters, who resoundingly said no. In between, Wang looked for leverage, even taking the Islanders to Kansas City, Mo., for an exhibition game. Then, Brooklyn, with its Barclays Center, made a deal too good to turn down. The team will depart after its lease expires at the Coliseum in 2015, more than three decades after its last championship. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to see them move when they should have a team on Long Island,\u201d said Al Arbour, the coach of the Stanley Cup teams, who now lives in Florida. \u201cThey got into a pickle and didn\u2019t move up in the playoffs. That cost them.\u201d Since Arbour left in 1994 after his second stint coaching the Islanders, a dozen coaches have led the team, which began as an expansion franchise in 1972. After lobbying by William Shea, who ushered the Mets into existence, the N.H.L. agreed to put a team in the newly built Coliseum to prevent the fledgling World Hockey Association from getting there first. After a first season that included 12 wins, the Islanders quickly transformed into a powerhouse whose accomplishments dwarfed those of the Rangers, their bitter and more glamorous rivals. Led by the Hall of Famers Mike Bossy, Bryan Trottier, Denis Potvin and Billy Smith, they won a record 19 straight playoff series. Given the trouble that followed, those players seem almost glad the team is moving. \u201cI felt terrible that the team won\u2019t be there anymore, but I\u2019m behind Charles 100 percent,\u201d Bossy, now the team\u2019s vice president of corporate sponsorships, said Wednesday. \u201cToday\u2019s today; yesterday\u2019s yesterday. We did what we did where we did, and now that\u2019s changing.\u201d Not long after Bossy retired, the team began its long slide. In 1992, John O. Pickett Jr., the longtime owner, sold 10 percent of the team to four businessmen who were tasked with running the Islanders. Other than a magical run in the 1992-93 playoffs, the Islanders failed to impress. In 1997, John Spano agreed to pay Pickett $165 million for the team and its cable television contract. But Spano was later convicted of bank and wire fraud for illegally obtaining loans to buy the team, so Pickett ended up selling the next year to Edward and Howard Milstein and Steven Gluckstern. The group, which ended up losing about $40 million before it sold to Wang and Kumar, sued SMG over safety concerns and briefly moved the team\u2019s furniture, files and memorabilia in a convoy of vans to an office in Manhattan. The group explored playing games in arenas as far away as Hartford. In some ways, the Islanders have outgrown Long Island, from which young people have fled to states where it is cheaper to live and jobs are more plentiful. \u201cIt was a dying franchise in an economy that has continued to decline,\u201d said Martin Cantor, the director of the Long Island Center for Socio-Economic Policy. But mainly, the Islanders have been undone by a rogues\u2019 gallery of managers and politicians unwilling or unable to help. This ought to upset the devoted fans. But after years of distress, they, too, seem hopeful that Brooklyn might prove more fertile. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be angry, but now I\u2019m excited,\u201d said Larry Ziegler, who lives in East Meadow, about a mile from the Coliseum, and has had season tickets for nearly 20 years. \u201cI see that they need to move to get to where they need to get to.\u201d Jeff Z. Klein contributed reporting."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/25\/world\/asia\/asian-schools-jump-in-rank.html","body":"When Christoph Kramer of Germany surveyed the field of universities offering undergraduate business programs, he focused on their locations as much as on their academic programs.\u201cChina is always in the media; everyone says it is the future,\u201d he said by telephone from D\u00fcsseldorf. So he enrolled in a three-year program at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, because he thought it would be a culturally enriching experience. According to a recent study on graduate employability, Mr. Kramer\u2019s H.K.U.S.T. degree puts him ahead of business graduates from many well-known Western universities. The 2012 Global Employability Survey, which is being released exclusively in the International Herald Tribune, characterized the ideal young candidate on the basis of skills, personal qualities and the schools they attended. The study, a collaboration of Emerging, a French consulting firm, and Trendence, a German research institute specializing in recruitment, asked hundreds of companies what they looked for when hiring recent graduates, regardless of their course of study. The study also asked employers what universities produced the ideal young graduates. In terms of desirable schools, U.S. and British universities retained their commanding lead. The list is dominated by the same names that top most rankings: Harvard, Yale, Cambridge, Oxford, Stanford, M.I.T., Columbia, Princeton and Imperial College London, with Goethe-University Frankfurt am Main rounding out the top 10. But Asian schools are also emerging. The most striking finding this year is the growth in the reputations of universities in China. Just outside the top 10 is Peking University, which leapt to No. 11 from No. 109 in just one year. This year, four mainland Chinese universities made the top 100, as opposed to only two last year. Shanghai Jiao Tong University went to No. 44 from No. 139. Meanwhile, H.K.U.S.T., where Mr. Kramer recently graduated, jumped to No. 46 from No. 94. The only Indian institution to make the list both last year and this year, the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, rose to No. 35 from No. 134. The fact that top Asian universities are being held in higher esteem is both a reflection on their success in preparing students for the global work force and the realization among employers that students trained in Asia are better equipped to work there. \u201cA lot of employers are looking for global players,\u201d said Tony Chan, H.K.U.S.T.\u2019s president. Dr. Chan attributes part of his institution\u2019s success to the fact that it bridges the gap between China and the rest of world. \u201cChina being the second-largest economy in the world is a huge factor,\u201d he said by telephone from Hong Kong. His institution\u2019s strength, he explained, lies in building bridges between different business cultures and languages. \u201cWe are one of the most international universities in China,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope to train graduates that know both East and West.\u201d Guy Breton, rector of the Universit\u00e9 de Montreal, also attributed his institution\u2019s position in the global ranking \u2014 No. 30 in the recent study, up from No. 46 in 2011 \u2014 to a successful combination of several cultures. \u201cWe teach in French; we are the most European of the North American universities, and I think that is of added value to employers,\u201d he said by telephone. According to Dr. Breton, Montreal\u2019s multiculturalism and multilingualism contribute to his university\u2019s openness and worldliness, something global employers are increasingly seeking. \u201cWe are exposed to the international reality,\u201d he said. The Emerging\/Trendence survey was conducted in two waves. Initially, 2,500 recruiters in 20 countries were asked to complete a personalized online survey designed to characterize the ideal new graduate. Several months later, more questions were asked of top recruiters from 10 countries deemed to be active employers. Those supplementary interviews resulted in the list of the top 150 global institutions in terms of graduate employability. In ranking the importance of second languages, aside from English, recruiters responded that they appreciated Chinese, French, Spanish, German, Japanese, Arabic, Italian, Russian and Portuguese, in that order. Global recruiters also listed the countries that produced the best graduates: the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Japan, Canada, India, China, France, Australia and Switzerland. The quality portion of the survey found that international recruiters appreciated soft skills like adaptability, communications and the \u201cability to work in a team,\u201d more than leadership qualities or \u201cthe ability to work under pressure.\u201d Steffen Laick, a top recruiter at Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, agreed that the ability to work with a team was important. Besides a strong and focused academic record, he also looked at extracurricular activities. \u201cNot everyone can have been a volunteer firefighter,\u201d he said by telephone. Showing recruiters that you have done something more than just fixated on studies is very important, he said. The universities also mattered, he said, because there might not be much more for recruiters to go on when the candidate is quite young and lacking in work experience. Many well-known universities have partnerships with global recruiters, which can help graduates in their applications and interviews. In other cases, universities have alumni networks that put recent graduates ahead of competitors from lesser-known schools. Not all emerging economies contributed to the top universities in terms of their attractiveness to employers, the survey found. Universities in Brazil, Russia and the Spanish-speaking countries of the Americas, for example, did not do as well in the rankings as Asian schools.

Mr. Kramer, after graduating from his global business program this year, found a job with the Boston Consulting Group in his hometown in Germany.

So he enrolled in a three-year program at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, because he thought it would be a culturally enriching experience. According to a recent study on graduate employability, Mr. Kramer\u2019s H.K.U.S.T. degree puts him ahead of business graduates from many well-known Western universities. The 2012 Global Employability Survey, which is being released exclusively in the International Herald Tribune, characterized the ideal young candidate on the basis of skills, personal qualities and the schools they attended. The study, a collaboration of Emerging, a French consulting firm, and Trendence, a German research institute specializing in recruitment, asked hundreds of companies what they looked for when hiring recent graduates, regardless of their course of study. The study also asked employers what universities produced the ideal young graduates. In terms of desirable schools, U.S. and British universities retained their commanding lead. The list is dominated by the same names that top most rankings: Harvard, Yale, Cambridge, Oxford, Stanford, M.I.T., Columbia, Princeton and Imperial College London, with Goethe-University Frankfurt am Main rounding out the top 10. But Asian schools are also emerging. The most striking finding this year is the growth in the reputations of universities in China. Just outside the top 10 is Peking University, which leapt to No. 11 from No. 109 in just one year. This year, four mainland Chinese universities made the top 100, as opposed to only two last year. Shanghai Jiao Tong University went to No. 44 from No. 139. Meanwhile, H.K.U.S.T., where Mr. Kramer recently graduated, jumped to No. 46 from No. 94. The only Indian institution to make the list both last year and this year, the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, rose to No. 35 from No. 134. The fact that top Asian universities are being held in higher esteem is both a reflection on their success in preparing students for the global work force and the realization among employers that students trained in Asia are better equipped to work there. \u201cA lot of employers are looking for global players,\u201d said Tony Chan, H.K.U.S.T.\u2019s president. Dr. Chan attributes part of his institution\u2019s success to the fact that it bridges the gap between China and the rest of world. \u201cChina being the second-largest economy in the world is a huge factor,\u201d he said by telephone from Hong Kong. His institution\u2019s strength, he explained, lies in building bridges between different business cultures and languages. \u201cWe are one of the most international universities in China,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope to train graduates that know both East and West.\u201d Guy Breton, rector of the Universit\u00e9 de Montreal, also attributed his institution\u2019s position in the global ranking \u2014 No. 30 in the recent study, up from No. 46 in 2011 \u2014 to a successful combination of several cultures. \u201cWe teach in French; we are the most European of the North American universities, and I think that is of added value to employers,\u201d he said by telephone. According to Dr. Breton, Montreal\u2019s multiculturalism and multilingualism contribute to his university\u2019s openness and worldliness, something global employers are increasingly seeking. \u201cWe are exposed to the international reality,\u201d he said. The Emerging\/Trendence survey was conducted in two waves. Initially, 2,500 recruiters in 20 countries were asked to complete a personalized online survey designed to characterize the ideal new graduate. Several months later, more questions were asked of top recruiters from 10 countries deemed to be active employers. Those supplementary interviews resulted in the list of the top 150 global institutions in terms of graduate employability. In ranking the importance of second languages, aside from English, recruiters responded that they appreciated Chinese, French, Spanish, German, Japanese, Arabic, Italian, Russian and Portuguese, in that order. Global recruiters also listed the countries that produced the best graduates: the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Japan, Canada, India, China, France, Australia and Switzerland. The quality portion of the survey found that international recruiters appreciated soft skills like adaptability, communications and the \u201cability to work in a team,\u201d more than leadership qualities or \u201cthe ability to work under pressure.\u201d Steffen Laick, a top recruiter at Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, agreed that the ability to work with a team was important. Besides a strong and focused academic record, he also looked at extracurricular activities. \u201cNot everyone can have been a volunteer firefighter,\u201d he said by telephone. Showing recruiters that you have done something more than just fixated on studies is very important, he said. The universities also mattered, he said, because there might not be much more for recruiters to go on when the candidate is quite young and lacking in work experience. Many well-known universities have partnerships with global recruiters, which can help graduates in their applications and interviews. In other cases, universities have alumni networks that put recent graduates ahead of competitors from lesser-known schools. Not all emerging economies contributed to the top universities in terms of their attractiveness to employers, the survey found. Universities in Brazil, Russia and the Spanish-speaking countries of the Americas, for example, did not do as well in the rankings as Asian schools. Brazil, which has the sixth-largest economy in the world, had only Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas, at No. 95, and the Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, at No. 112. The study also lists two Mexican universities \u2014 Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey and Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico \u2014 at 110 and 113, respectively, but no other Latin American universities were represented. \u201cIt is surprising that Brazil and Mexico, that have really good universities, are low on the list; they are still too focused on American universities,\u201d Sandrine Belloc of Emerging, the company that designed the study, said about recruiters in those countries.

For many years he worked as a futures trader, buying and selling complicated financial instruments tied to movements in the price of stocks and commodities in the United States and government bonds across Europe. Like Sherman McCoy, the bond trader at the heart of Tom Wolfe\u2019s novel \u201cThe Bonfire of the Vanities,\u201d successful traders can earn enough money to live like \u201cMasters of the Universe.\u201dAs the headlines about Kweku Adoboli , the former UBS trader accused of causing losses of $2.3 billion, show, however, the fall from grace can be dramatic. After several years as a trader, Mr. Dukes was put in charge of his employer\u2019s training and recruitment efforts. The company, Futex, had long offered ambitious university graduates an intensive 12-week training course with the promise that the best-performing recruits would be able to continue trading with the company\u2019s backing \u2014 and its money. Futex also had an apprenticeship program for people who wished to skip university and get onto the trading floor more quickly, after a year of training. Both training routes are popular. \u201cWe get somewhere in the region of 200 applicants a week,\u201d Mr. Dukes said. The problem, he said, is that while the company can test applicants for mathematical ability and knowledge about the markets, \u201cit\u2019s very difficult to say how people will perform once they start trading with real money.\u201d Futex is a proprietary trading business, meaning that employees trade on the company\u2019s account rather than on behalf of clients. They keep a share of their profits that starts at 50 percent and can rise to 90 percent for those who are most successful. \u201cOn an exceptional day, you can make six figures,\u201d Mr. Dukes said. But a run of bad trades can wipe out the company\u2019s profit. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that in order to maintain an edge over the market in today\u2019s world, an increase in academic knowledge is required,\u201d he said. Mr. Dukes took his problem to the University of Hertfordshire , which responded by offering to develop a Master of Science degree in proprietary trading. It is a one-year course for those who choose to study full time, but \u201cstudents can also dip in and out,\u201d Quintin McKellar, vice chancellor of the university, said in an interview. The first group of 20 students began classes on Oct. 1; a second intake will start in January. Tuition for the course is \u00a316,000, or about $25,600. \u201cThere\u2019s no difference in fees from any of our other master\u2019s degree courses,\u201d Dr. McKellar said. However, instead of traveling to the university\u2019s campus in Hatfield, which is just north of London, students will \u201cspend a lot of time on the trading floor, with actual traders,\u201d he said. Dr. McKellar, who was formerly the dean of the Royal Veterinary College in London, said that the University of Hertfordshire was increasingly seeking opportunities to offer what he called \u201ccorporate degrees,\u201d partly as a response to cuts in government financing. \u201cWe have a subsidiary company called Exemplas that began as a way of helping small- and medium-sized businesses,\u201d Dr. McKellar said. \u201cThat work used to be funded by government, but funding for that sort of thing has dried up.\u201d \u201cThe whole ethos behind a corporate degree is that, instead of forcing the business to choose from courses we already offer, it lets the business act as the senior partner,\u201d he added. Mr. Dukes, the trader, agreed. \u201cWe were able to cherry-pick the elements we wanted,\u201d he said. The first 14 weeks of the course are spent primarily on the company\u2019s electronic trading floor, either at its headquarters in Woking, southwest of London, or at its office in London\u2019s financial district. The next 14-week module is devoted to classes on markets, financial institutions and policy, followed by another 14 weeks learning about the global economy. \u201cWe want traders who can understand the impact of macroeconomic events on share prices,\u201d Mr. Dukes said. \u201cThey need to understand the impact of the sovereign debt crisis on bond prices in different currencies, and the possible influence of decisions made by the European Central Bank, governments or the European Commission.\u201d Students spend the final seven weeks of the course working on a thesis based on data they have gathered during the course. \u201cFutex has made a commitment to hire some of the graduates,\u201d Dr. McKellar said. He added that students in the university\u2019s corporate degree programs \u201chave a slightly better record of graduating with first-class honors\u201d \u2014 the highest academic achievement \u2014 than other students. As to the risk that Hertfordshire trading graduates might end up in the wrong kind of headlines, Jonathan Easter, chair of the university\u2019s finance and economics department, said: \u201cThe program is designed to help graduates develop the ability to build sustainable, successful positions.\u201d \u201cThis is vital for them, not least because ultimately they will be trading on their own account, not with client money,\u201d Mr. Easter said. \u201cThe program will therefore ensure that graduates are aware of all relevant regulatory controls, and Futex will closely monitor behavior and trades of all graduates who go on to work for them.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/25\/world\/europe\/greek-unemployed-cut-off-from-medical-treatment.html","body":"ATHENS \u2014 As the head of Greece\u2019s largest oncology department, Dr. Kostas Syrigos thought he had seen everything. But nothing prepared him for Elena, an unemployed woman whose breast cancer had been diagnosed a year before she came to him.By that time, her cancer had grown to the size of an orange and broken through the skin, leaving a wound that she was draining with paper napkins. \u201cWhen we saw her we were speechless,\u201d said Dr. Syrigos, the chief of oncology at Sotiria General Hospital in central Athens. \u201cEveryone was crying. Things like that are described in textbooks, but you never see them because until now, anybody who got sick in this country could always get help.\u201d Life in Greece has been turned on its head since the debt crisis took hold. But in few areas has the change been more striking than in health care. Until recently, Greece had a typical European health system, with employers and individuals contributing to a fund that with government assistance financed universal care. People who lost their jobs received health care and unemployment benefits for a year, but were still treated by hospitals if they could not afford to pay even after the benefits expired. Things changed in July 2011, when Greece signed a supplemental loan agreement with international lenders to ward off financial collapse. Now, as stipulated in the deal,\u00a0 Greeks must pay all costs out of pocket after their benefits expire. About half of Greece\u2019s 1.2 million long-term unemployed lack health insurance, a number that is expected to rise sharply in a country with an unemployment rate of 25 percent and a moribund economy, said Savas Robolis, director of the Labor Institute of the General Confederation of Greek Workers. A new $17.5 billion austerity package of budget cuts and tax increases, agreed upon Wednesday with Greece\u2019s international lenders, will make matters only worse, most economists say. The changes are forcing increasing numbers of people to seek help outside the traditional health care system. Elena, for example, was referred to Dr. Syrigos by doctors in an underground movement that has sprung up here to care for the uninsured. \u201cIn Greece right now, to be unemployed means death,\u201d said Dr. Syrigos, an imposing man with a stern demeanor that grew soft when discussing the plight of cancer patients. The development is new for Greeks \u2014 and perhaps for Europe, too. \u201cWe are moving to the same situation that the United States has been in, where when you lose your job and you are uninsured, you aren\u2019t covered,\u201d Dr. Syrigos said. The change is particularly striking in cancer care, with its lengthy and expensive treatments. When cancer is diagnosed among the uninsured, \u201cthe system simply ignores them,\u201d Dr. Syrigos said. He said, \u201cThey can\u2019t access chemotherapy, surgery or even simple drugs.\u201d The health care system itself is increasingly dysfunctional, and may worsen if the government slashes an additional $2 billion in health spending, which it has proposed as part of a new austerity plan aimed to lock down more financing. With the state coffers drained, supplies have gotten so low that some patients have been forced to bring their own supplies, like stents and syringes, for treatments. Hospitals and pharmacies now demand cash payment for drugs, which for cancer patients can amount to tens of thousands of dollars, money most of them do not have. With the system deteriorating, Dr. Syrigos and several colleagues have decided to take matters into their own hands. Earlier this year, they set up a surreptitious network to help uninsured cancer patients and other ill people, which operates off the official grid using only spare medicines donated by pharmacies, some pharmaceutical companies and even the families of cancer patients who died. In Greece, doctors found to be helping an uninsured person using hospital medicines must cover the cost from their own pockets. At the Metropolitan Social Clinic, a makeshift medical center near an abandoned American Air Force base outside Athens, Dr. Giorgos Vichas pointed one recent afternoon to plastic bags crammed with donated medicines lining the dingy floors outside his office. \u201cWe\u2019re a Robin Hood network,\u201d said Dr. Vichas, a cardiologist who founded the underground movement in January. \u201cBut this operation has an expiration date,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople at some point will no longer be able to donate because of the crisis. That\u2019s why we\u2019re pressuring the state to take responsibility again.\u201d In a supply room, a blue filing cabinet was filled with cancer drugs. But they were not enough to take care of the rising number of cancer patients knocking on his door. Many of the medicines are forwarded to Dr. Syrigos, who set up an off-hours infirmary in the hospital three months ago to treat uninsured cancer patients Dr. Vichas and other doctors in the network send his way. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb Dimitris Bounias contributed reporting.

Paris, one of the most prestigious business schools in France, the news was welcomed by both academics and digital entrepreneurs.The Google@HEC chair \u2014 the first direct investment by the company in a business school \u2014 is seen as a sign that Europe is finally trying to catch up with the United States in teaching digital entrepreneurship. While it is not the first European foray into this field, it comes amid the realization that universities in Europe are lagging behind their U.S. counterparts. \u201cWe need role models for the digital economy,\u201d said Elo\u00efc-Anil Peyrache, an associate dean at H.E.C. Dr. Peyrache said that students were becoming more interested in the subject. \u201cMost of this is the willingness to open up your new company, of which two-thirds is related to the Web,\u201d he said. A decade ago, most of H.E.C.\u2019s graduates would have found employment in big corporations or consulting firms, but the more recent graduates were more likely to go at it alone, he said. The grandes \u00e9coles, the elite French schools where most corporate or government leaders are traditionally trained, have been teaching digital entrepreneurship for several years. Business schools are seeing the urgency of building e-business curriculums and programs lest they miss out. \u201cIn the next coming years there will be a difference in the business schools where this is worked out and those where it won\u2019t be,\u201d said Bernard Ramanantsoa, H.E.C.\u2019s dean. Essec , another grande \u00e9cole, started teaching \u201cManaging IT in a Networked World\u201d last year as part of its Global M.B.A. program, which is taught in both Paris and Singapore. The course combines the more traditional discipline of information technology management with e-business. Peter O\u2019Connor, who teaches the course at Essec, said it had been conceived to keep up with what he called the \u201cdigitalization\u201d of virtually all aspects of business. \u201cThe wide-scale acceptance of it has come in the last two or three years, as we\u2019ve seen the value of having a digital strategy in vast amounts of businesses,\u201d Dr. O\u2019Connor said. A course on e-business entrepreneurship, also in its second year at Essec, is especially popular because, together with another course on business planning, it allows students to apply to the school\u2019s incubator, which provides start-ups with seed money and office space. Professor Antonio D\u00e1vila, who heads the Entrepreneurship Department at the I.E.S.E. Business School , which has campuses around Spain, said that online commerce was by far the most popular post-graduate plan among his students. \u201cDigital entrepreneurship is what marketing was in the \u201980s and \u201990s and banking and consulting in the 2000s,\u201d he said. Part of the appeal resulted from decreasing interest in more traditional fields because of the global economic slowdown. \u201cOn the Internet, if you are successful in about five years, you\u2019re global,\u201d he said. More business schools are using both traditional professors and outside experts who are well-versed in real-life changes. This is the strategy that the Google@HEC chair employs. Instead of paying for a single professorship, as the word \u201cchair\u201d might suggest, Google is supplying the school with experts, both from its own ranks and from outside companies. \u201cWhat they can learn is how to actually use the practical experience of building and running an e-commerce Web site,\u201d said Michel B\u00e9nard, who is university relations manager at Google France. Celine Lazorthes, an H.E.C. graduate and digital entrepreneur who now mentors students at her alma mater, said that Google\u2019s investment was a step forward. \u201cIn France, we need to make better links with companies,\u201d she said. Ms. Lazorthes thinks that students, particularly those opening H.E.C.-based start-ups, can benefit from Google\u2019s technical guidance and market data. In Denmark, the Copenhagen Business Schools, or C.B.S., has tried to teach the subject for decades, said Jan Damsgaard, the head of the Department of IT Management. The school was a pioneer in developing a center of electronic commerce in 1998, with a dedicated professor and a resource center, but it may have been too early for its own good. In 2005, it shut down when the dot-com bubble burst, and it never reopened. Still, the school is considered to be on the cutting edge of including instruction on doing business online. Since last year, C.B.S. has offered a course on social media marketing. \u201cNowadays it is in everything,\u201d said Dr. Damsgaard about e-business at C.B.S. Still, the United States is far ahead in promoting Internet companies. \u201cIf you are trying to prepare business students for the world and you are not taking into account digital technology, you are failing in your mission,\u201d said Andrew McAfee , a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr. McAfee, who teaches and researches the business effects of information technology, said U.S. schools were better placed to attract outside experts, since most of them worked in the country. \u201cIt is easy for us to bring people into class,\u201d he said. \u201cHigh-tech is mainly centered in the States.\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connor of Essec said that the United States was several years ahead of Europe and Asia, mostly because of the presence of venture capital and the positive attitude toward risk-taking, and even failure, in e-business in the United States. \u201cThere is such a concentration of talent, money and facilities in Silicon Valley that it is going to be successful for a very long time,\u201d he said. However, he was optimistic about transferring that expertise across the Atlantic and around the world. As e-businesses gain importance in places like Russia, China and India, the global expertise and demand will no longer be focused in the United States. Business school curriculums will follow the trend, he explained. \u201cThe amount we\u2019re trailing is definitely reducing rapidly and will disappear,\u201d he said of European business schools."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/25\/world\/middleeast\/iran-makes-arrests-in-violations-of-money-trading.html","body":"Fifty people in Iran have been arrested on money trading violations since a crackdown on foreign-exchange dealings linked to the plunging value of Iran\u2019s currency provoked a riot and antigovernment demonstration in Tehran three weeks ago, the country\u2019s intelligence minister said Wednesday.The arrests reported by the minister, Heydar Moslehi, doubled the number initially reported in the aftermath of the Oct. 3 disturbances, and suggested that the Iranian authorities had widened their investigation into the foreign-exchange dealings, which revealed deep worries in Iran about the instability of the currency, the rial. The rial lost 40 percent of its value against the dollar in early October, and has recovered only marginally since then, which many outside analysts call a bald reflection of the Iranian government\u2019s mismanagement of an economic crisis caused in part by the West\u2019s punitive anti-nuclear sanctions. Onerous restrictions on Iran\u2019s oil exports and banking transactions have caused steep drops in Iran\u2019s foreign income, leading to shortages of foreign goods and accelerated inflation. Mr. Moslehi, in remarks reported by Iran state radio, said that his operatives had been successful in \u201cidentifying and arresting the individuals who had created disorders in Iran\u2019s foreign exchange market.\u201d The minister also suggested that other suspects might be at large and that they might be engaging in unspecified cooperation with foreign enemies who want to subvert Iran\u2019s economy. \u201cI warn those individuals, who are cooperating with outsiders, not to use the atmosphere for creating sedition against the Revolution and the sacred system of the Islamic Republic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are monitoring the nature of their moves.\u201d Mr. Moslehi\u2019s remarks came a day after Iran\u2019s oil minister, Rostam Qasemi, threatened to retaliate against any further tightening of Western sanctions by terminating all Iranian exports of oil, the country\u2019s most important product. But Mr. Qasemi\u2019s threat was considered to be largely bluster.

Health care. Immigration. Financial regulation.They are the issues that have dominated the political debate in recent years and have played a prominent role in this presidential campaign. But in many ways they have obscured what is arguably the nation\u2019s biggest challenge: breaking out of a decade of income stagnation that has afflicted the middle class and the poor and exacerbated inequality. Many of the bedrock assumptions of American culture \u2014 about work, progress, fairness and optimism \u2014 are being shaken as successive generations worry about the prospect of declining living standards. No question, perhaps, is more central to the country\u2019s global standing than whether the economy will perform better on that score in the future than it has in the recent past. The question has helped create a volatile period in American politics, with Democrats gaining large victories in 2006 and 2008, only to have Republicans return the favor in 2010. This year, economic anxiety, especially in industrial battlegrounds like Ohio, is driving the campaign strategies of both President Obama and Mitt Romney. The causes of income stagnation are varied and lack the political simplicity of calls to bring down the deficit or avert another Wall Street meltdown. They cannot be quickly remedied through legislation from Washington. The biggest causes, according to interviews with economists over the last several months, are not the issues that dominate the political debate. At the top of the list are the digital revolution, which has allowed machines to replace many forms of human labor, and the modern wave of globalization, which has allowed millions of low-wage workers around the world to begin competing with Americans. Not much further down the list is education, probably the country\u2019s most diffuse, localized area of government policy. As skill levels have become even more important for prosperity, the United States has lost its once-large global lead in educational attainment. Some of the disconnect between the economy\u2019s problems and the solutions offered by Washington stem from the nature of the current political debate. The presidential campaign has been more focused on Bain Capital and an \u201capology tour\u201d than on the challenges created by globalization and automation. But economists and other analysts also point to the scale of the problem. No other rich country \u2014 not Japan, not any nation in Europe \u2014 has figured out exactly how to respond to the challenges. \u201cThe whole notion of the American dream,\u201d said Frank Levy, an M.I.T. economist, \u201cdescribed a mass upward mobility that is just a lot harder to achieve right now.\u201d For the first time since the Great Depression, median family income has fallen substantially over an entire decade. Income grew slowly through most of the last decade, except at the top of the distribution, before falling sharply when the financial crisis began. By last year, family income was 8 percent lower than it had been 11 years earlier, at its peak in 2000, according to inflation-adjusted numbers from the Census Bureau. On average in 11-year periods in the decades just after World War II, inflation-adjusted median income rose by almost 30 percent. Matching the growth rates of the postwar period \u2014 when the country was poorer, when harsh discrimination against women and minorities was receding and when the rest of the world was weaker \u2014 is probably impossible. Yet there is still a vast difference, both economically and politically, between incomes that are rising modestly and not at all. Historically, periods of economic stagnation have tended to bring pessimism, political turmoil and a lack of social progress, said Benjamin Friedman, an economic historian and the author of \u201cThe Moral Consequences of Economic Growth.\u201d The political volatility and partisan rancor of the last several years seem to fit the pattern. The recent stagnation has also led, economists say, to confusion and even scapegoating about the real sources of the problem. The causes that can seem obvious, and that often shape the political debate, are not necessarily the correct ones. Take immigration, especially illegal immigration. Whatever other problems it may cause, evidence suggests that it has not played a significant role in the income slump. It may have caused a slight decline in the wages of native-born workers without a high school diploma (and maybe not even that). But most illegal immigrants lack the skills to compete with the bulk of native workers, according to research by Giovanni Peri, Chad Sparber and others. Notably, incomes in some states with large immigrant populations, like California, have risen faster than in states with relatively few immigrants, like Ohio. The minimum wage, similarly, appears to play only a minor role in the income slump. It has risen faster than inflation since 2000, even as overall pay at the bottom of the income distribution has not. And the size of the federal government also looks like a dog that is not barking: Washington collected taxes equal to 15.4 percent of gross domestic product last year, down from 20.6 percent in 2000. A second group of much-cited forces have indeed played a role in middle-class stagnation and inequality, many economists argue, just not as big a role as automation, globalization or education. Health care costs have grown sharply over the last decade, leaving employers with less cash to use on salaries. Labor unions have shrunk; all else equal, unionized workers earn more, often at the expense of corporate profits. Tax rates have fallen more for the affluent than for anyone else, directly increasing the take-home pay of top earners and indirectly giving them more incentive to earn large amounts. But many of these factors are particular to the United States, while globalization and automation are obviously universal forces. One of the more striking recent developments in economics has been economists\u2019 growing acceptance of the idea that globalization has held down pay for a large swath of workers. The public has long accepted the idea, but economists resisted it, pointing to the long-term benefits of trade. \u201cThat is starting to change only in the face of very strong evidence over the past decade,\u201d said Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations. In particular, job growth and wage growth have been weaker in sectors exposed to global competition \u2014 especially from China \u2014 than in sectors that are more insulated. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/24\/opinion\/friedman-our-secret-sauce.html","body":"It was striking how much Monday\u2019s presidential debate on foreign policy came down to two subjects: America and the Middle East. The two actually provide some instructive contrasts, starting with one that I\u2019ve noted since the onset of this campaign: the contrast between the high degree of American pluralism and trust that makes our country work, and the near total absence of it in the Middle East, the region most vexing us and most likely to blow up on the next president. Muslims are killing Muslims across the Middle East and Central Asia today: Sunnis versus Shiites, Pashtuns versus Pashtuns and Kurds versus Turks. Christians are not faring well there, either. The absence of pluralism and the prevalence of \u201crule or die\u201d politics \u2014 either my sect or party is in power or I\u2019m dead \u2014 is the dominant political trend in the Arab-Muslim region today. Nobody trusts anybody, but it is impossible to build a modern state or an innovation economy without trust. Meanwhile, here in America, we are debating whether to replace our first black president \u2014 whose middle name is Hussein and whose grandfather was a Muslim \u2014 with a Mormon! Who does that? Nobody else. That radical pluralism is the secret of our sauce, and blessedly so. America, take a bow.But not for too long. We have a very special country, but we have to take care of it, not kick it around like it\u2019s a football. And we can\u2019t do that if we\u2019re imitating the Middle East\u2019s rule-or-die politics: my party or scorched earth. Barack Obama has been far from a perfect president. At times, he has treated friends and opponents with arrogance or just a stubborn unwillingness to play the game of politics to co-opt those who needed to be co-opted (he should have embraced the Bowles-Simpson federal debt plan) to get legislation passed. No one would confuse Obama for Lyndon Johnson. But no one would confuse today\u2019s Republican Party for the G.O.P. of the 1960s or 1970s, either. It is impossible to look at the G.O.P.\u2019s behavior in the last four years \u2014 from its unwillingness to consider Obama\u2019s jobs bill, which was praised by independent economists, to the unwillingness of its presidential candidates to consider a $1 increase in taxes for $10 of spending cuts, to the time it spent on sheer lunacy such as questioning the president\u2019s birth certificate \u2014 and not conclude that many in the party just wanted Obama to fail in the hope that they could pick up the pieces. Too many Republicans, particularly moderate business types, don\u2019t want to admit how much their party has been led around of late, not by traditional conservatives, but by a radical Tea Party base that has driven decent, smart conservatives \u2014 like Bob Bennett of Utah, Bob Inglis of South Carolina, Richard Lugar of Indiana and Olympia Snowe of Maine \u2014 out of office. What I\u2019d say about Obama\u2019s domestic and Middle East policies is that, given the messes and political constraints he inherited in both arenas, he did about as well as anyone could. He kept the homeland safe, prevented us from getting drawn into any sinkholes and killed bad guys. It is not the stuff of foreign policy legend, but it was not bad. I\u2019d say the same at home. He stanched the bleeding in the economy and initiated some smart reforms in education, energy and health \u2014 the true effectiveness of which we will only know in the future. It was not exactly the New Deal, but considering the deep hole created by the years of George W. Bush, it also was not a New Depression. A quick turnaround in either arena was never possible. But while that kind of politics got us through the last four years, it won\u2019t get us through the next four. We cannot have another term of partisan gridlock. We are heading into a world where the breakdown of the European supranational state system, combined with the breakdown of the Arab nation state system, combined with climate change, combined with a much greater global interdependence, means that we will be more and more buffeted by problems that are too dangerous to ignore but too complicated and big to fix alone. And when a country finds itself in that kind of situation, there is one thing it absolutely must do, and that is build resiliency. We need to weatherproof our house so we can control our destiny and play the vital stabilizing role the world needs us to play. And that leads to another difference between us and the Middle East. We don\u2019t know how to fix their problems anymore. But we do know how to fix our problems. In the short run, we have to invest in infrastructure, education and research \u2014 the sources of our strength to stimulate growth \u2014 while simultaneously putting in place a credible long-term plan to cut spending and both raise and reform taxes as our economy improves. Regardless of what they have on their Web sites, neither candidate has spoken honestly to voters in their speeches or commercials about what this will take. Hey, it\u2019s election time. What else is new? Well, there is something new. Just doing as well as our domestic political constraints will allow will not cut it anymore \u2014 not given where the global economy, the Middle East and climate change are going. Just doing what the political traffic will bear will not lead us to resiliency. It will lead us to painful, destabilizing vulnerability. We need a whole new traffic pattern. That will require a president who will dare to challenge the country to do big, hard things together, not just tack with the winds of public opinion, and it will require an electorate that is ready to value and demand such leadership."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/24\/opinion\/why-the-fed-should-buy-munis-not-mortgages.html","body":"Stanford, Calif.IN September, the Federal Reserve announced that it would begin purchasing $40 billion of mortgage-backed bonds every month until the outlook for the labor market improved substantially or inflation reared its ugly head. The Fed hopes that these purchases will lower mortgage rates, boost new construction, prop up home values, lift stock prices and otherwise energize the moribund job market. Experts disagree on whether these purchases will stimulate employment and promote recovery, or trigger an inflationary spiral and saddle the Fed with substantial losses if interest rates spike before the Fed can unwind its position. We don\u2019t intend to weigh in on these debates \u2014 but we do want to start a different one: is the mortgage market really the smartest place to spend all this money? Wouldn\u2019t the Fed get more employment bang for its monetary buck by purchasing state and municipal bonds? Instead of a third round of so-called \u201cquantitative easing,\u201d known in the financial markets as QE3, maybe it\u2019s time for a QE-Muni. Here\u2019s why. State and municipal bonds help finance new infrastructure projects like roads and bridges, as well as pay for some government salaries and services, by borrowing against future tax receipts. With about $3.7 trillion in debt outstanding, it\u2019s a big and sprawling marketplace for bonds. But even at that size, it\u2019s less than half as large as the securitized mortgage market. So every Fed dollar spent in the muni market would absorb a larger percentage of outstanding debt and is likely to have a greater effect on reducing the bonds\u2019 interest rates than the same expenditure in the mortgage market. The greater the effect in reducing borrowing costs in either market, the more powerful the impact on employment is likely to be. In addition, while the current Fed program helps keep mortgage rates low, its effect on the economy isn\u2019t direct. Rock-bottom rates, naturally, will prompt some to buy homes or spend more on renovations \u2014 both of which spur job creation. But some homeowners will simply refinance to increase their savings, which has a less immediate stimulus effect. In contrast, lowering the borrowing costs for states, cities and counties should not only forestall tax increases (which dampen individual spending), but also make it easier for local governments to pay for police officers, firefighters, teachers and infrastructure improvements. Finally, while the private sector is hiring (with a net gain of 4.7 million jobs since February 2010), the public sector continues to lay off workers. We\u2019ve lost a million government jobs since 2010. Republicans and Democrats alike have been decrying the failure to stimulate the economy through the infrastructure improvements that are necessary to keep our economy competitive. But shrinking tax revenues and limited debt service capacity have tied the hands of state and local governments. To be sure, our proposal raises pragmatic, political and legal challenges. For starters, the muni bond market is highly fragmented, and many bond issues are illiquid. Having the Fed train billions of dollars of buying firepower on this market could roil the pricing of individual bond offerings. This problem could be addressed, we think, by having the Fed announce the amount and quality of muni debt that it\u2019s willing to buy in a given month; sellers could then choose whether or not to come to the table. (That would also allow the Fed to sidestep the politically loaded question of which state\u2019s bonds to buy: the market can make that decision.) From a political perspective, some will object that our plan would unfairly bail out states and municipalities that have been profligate in the past, a problem economists call moral hazard. Such an objection might be addressed, in part, by restricting the Fed to purchases of bonds that pay for critical infrastructure or hiring rather than, say, new sports stadiums. A still bigger problem with our proposal is simple. It is illegal, at least as the law currently stands. The Federal Reserve Act prohibits the Fed from purchasing muni debt with a maturity of more than six months, and none of the beneficial effects we predict from QE-Muni can occur unless the Fed is able to buy longer-dated muni paper. But after the elections, Congress will head into the mother of all negotiation sessions as it tries to avoid the fiscal cliff. All options will be on the table. And as both Republicans and Democrats look for strategies that create the greatest number of jobs at the lowest cost to the public treasury, wouldn\u2019t it make sense to give the Fed another tool to help it spend our money more effectively? Yes, we can and should debate whether another round of quantitative easing is the medicine that the economy needs now. But if it\u2019s the medicine we\u2019re destined to get, shouldn\u2019t we do all we can to assure that it works as best it can? Joseph A. Grundfest, Mark A. Lemley and George G. Triantis are professors at Stanford Law School.

The president\u2019s budget, as scored by the Congressional Budget Office, would stabilize the ratio of federal debt to the economy over 10 years. What is more disturbing is that the comment displays willful ignorance about the lessons of Greece, and such ignorance can only lead to bad policy decisions at home. The lesson that should be learned from Greece is that its fiscal mess has been made far worse by severe budget cuts. New data from the European Union, released on Monday and analyzed in The Times by Landon Thomas Jr. and David Jolly, show that countries that have most ruthlessly cut their budgets \u2014 Greece, especially \u2014 have seen their overall debt loads increase as a share of the economy. The data provide objective support for what has been clear to just about everyone except pro-austerity German officials and deficit-crazed Republican politicians. Namely, deep government budget cuts at a time of economic weakness are counterproductive, complicating, if not ruining, the chances for economic growth. The new European statistics also dovetail with a recent analysis by economists from the International Monetary Fund. They found that budget cutbacks are much more damaging to economies recovering from recession than has been previously believed. The reason is that with interest rates stuck near zero, there is no room to lower them when fiscal policy is tightened, and thus no way to offset the pain of budget cutbacks. If governments push ahead anyway with deep spending cuts, the result is only more economic weakness without the hoped for budget improvement. That has been the case in Greece and other nations of Europe, like Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Britain. If Republican policies to slash government programs while excessively cutting taxes were carried out here, the United States would experience a similar effect. Taken together, the Greek experience and the recent European research, show that for the United States, a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d on the deficit should include two main parts: spending in the near term to boost the recovery, coupled with tax increases, and spending cuts to reduce the deficit as the economy regains its health. Mr. Obama is better positioned than Mr. Romney to deliver that agenda. Mr. Obama could make his jobs plan, introduced last September but blocked by Congressional Republicans, part of the budget package to be negotiated after the election, when politicians must agree on tax increases and spending cuts to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff. Mr. Romney\u2019s agenda is missing a direct focus on jobs, foolishly relying instead on high-end tax cuts and deregulation to help the recovery. And he and his party continue to insist on premature deficit reduction that, in a fragile economy, is the real road to Greece."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/24\/business\/better-ways-to-deal-with-china.html","body":"Less than a year into a new administration, the nation\u2019s trade deficit is soaring. Manufacturers are complaining bitterly that an overvalued dollar is destroying the economy, driving businesses abroad. Congress is bubbling with proposals to punish countries that are flooding the United States with cheaper exports.The gimlet-eyed realists in the new administration decide it is time to get tough, and it works. Within four years, the currencies of our main trading partners have risen sharply against the dollar; the exchange rate of our main Asian rival has jumped by a third. The trade deficit starts to recede. America \u2014 undisputed leader of the free world \u2014 gets to carve one more notch in its belt. This is the type of success Mitt Romney hoped to conjure up during the foreign policy debate on Monday night when he promised to get tough on China from \u201cDay 1,\u201d designating China a currency manipulator and opening the door for trade sanctions. It is also the image President Obama wanted to convey when he countered that he has been twice as tough on China as his predecessor, George W. Bush. The vignette, however, is old. It comes from Ronald Reagan\u2019s second term, when Japan rather than China inspired fears of American decline. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, a k a the Velvet Hammer, summoned the finance ministers of Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to the White and Gold Room of the Plaza Hotel in New York on Sept. 22, 1985, to devise an agreement to weaken the dollar. We also got tough with our trading partners in 1971, when the Nixon administration imposed a 10 percent surcharge on imports to force them \u2014 Japan, above all \u2014 to revalue their currencies and help right an American trade balance that was sliding into deficit for the first time since the 19th century. Tempting as it is, that approach to economic policy is unlikely to be very effective today. In the 1970s and \u201980s, the club of industrial democracies was bound by the common Soviet threat. Japan, protected by the American nuclear umbrella, would do what the United States wanted. Today the Soviet Union is gone. China may not be as powerful as the United States, but it is powerful enough to hit back. More important, trying to push China around like a bulked-up version of 1980s Japan does not fit with our national interests. In fact, it puts at risk a central, long-term American objective: drawing China into the club of prosperous, rule-bound and democratic nations. As the economists Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson warn in their new book, \u201cWhy Nations Fail,\u201d China\u2019s autocratic government will end up suppressing prosperity, stifling innovation as it clings to power and breeding instability as factions fight for the spoils of growth. Helping steer China away from such an unstable, dangerous course is a core American goal. China\u2019s economy is slowing sharply. Political turmoil is swirling just weeks before only the second peaceful transition of power in the history of the Chinese Communist Party. Loud, unilateral American toughness at this stage is unlikely to help. It may prompt a reaction against the more outward-looking, reform-minded constituencies, strengthening conservative forces that are unwilling to cede any political control. And for all this risk, getting tough is unlikely to deliver much. The Chinese currency is the wrong target. Of course China has been manipulating its currency for years, buying mountains of dollars to keep the renminbi cheap and give its exporters a leg up. But Beijing appears ready to correct course. Factoring in China\u2019s fast inflation, which makes its exports more expensive, the real value of the renminbi has risen at least 15 percent against the dollar since mid-2010. Beijing has curbed its dollar hoarding. And its broad trade surplus is falling fast: down to 2.3 percent of its economic output this year from more than 10 percent in 2007. China\u2019s trade surplus with the United States is in part an illusion, because exports assembled in China from imported components are counted as 100 percent Chinese. Yuqing Xing, an economist at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo, estimates that China contributed only 3 percent to the value of its exports of iPhones and laptops in 2009. Chinese labor costs accounted for only $6.50 of the $178.96 wholesale cost of an iPhone 3G exported by China, according to a study by Mr. Xing and Neal Detert. Japanese components accounted for $60.60, German parts for $30.15, Korean components for $22.96 and American parts for $10.75. The numbers are rough. Some of the parts may have been made in China. Still, counting the entire $178.96 as a Chinese export vastly overstates its role. Even if we conclude that currency manipulation alone is causing our bilateral trade deficit \u2014 a highly unlikely proposition \u2014 we can\u2019t blame it on China. \u201cWe have an Asian trade deficit,\u201d said Clyde Prestowitz, a former trade adviser to the Reagan administration. \u201cIf we were serious, we would say there are a number of countries manipulating their currency and distorting the world economy.\u201d 1 2 Next Page \u00bb E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/24\/business\/economy\/companies-arent-as-optimistic-as-consumers.html","body":"Consumers may finally be feeling more optimistic about the economy, but corporate America is not sharing the sentiment.A host of market bellwethers reported disappointing results Tuesday and cut their outlook for future growth, sending stocks into a tailspin and highlighting the divide between companies and consumers. It was Wall Street\u2019s second big drop in the last three trading days, with household names like Xerox, 3M and DuPont leading the way down as the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 240 points. The Dow is now down 3.7 percent from its high for the year reached earlier this month. The concerns among business leaders extend well beyond earnings \u2014 a Federal Reserve regional survey released Tuesday showed new signs of weakness in the domestic manufacturing sector, even as global growth slows. Corporate executives also reiterated the danger posed to the economy if Washington cannot avert sharp tax increases and spending cuts in early January, the fiscal cliff that many economists say heightens the risk of recession. This uncertainty is compounded by the prospect of a new Fed chairman by early 2014. The pessimism is all the more notable because after years of wariness, consumers are feeling more buoyant. Consumer confidence is at its highest point since before the financial crisis. The housing market is showing signs of life. And retail sales actually sped up in the third quarter, fueling the hopes of retailers for a robust holiday season. \u201cNormally, you think of consumer confidence as more important,\u201d said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cBut the business sector is a quarter or two ahead this time.\u201d One reason for the disparity is that businesses are much more focused on conditions abroad than consumers in the United States. With growth in China slowing and parts of Europe in recession, cooling international sales are weighing on corporate earnings. The prospect of slowing global demand for oil generated a sell-off Tuesday, as crude fell 2.2 percent, to $86.67, its lowest level since July. Indeed, the sectors that rely more on international sales have been among those hit the hardest. Xerox, 3M and United Technologies each lowered their outlook. While the fiscal cliff looms large in boardrooms, consumers are less concerned about whether Congress will extend Bush-era tax cuts set to expire in January and whether it will come up with a deal to cut the deficit and avert automatic spending cuts. \u201cClearly, there is something going on, with consumers going one way and businesses going the other,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics. Looking ahead, optimists say the new willingness of consumers to spend will ultimately bolster corporate results, but there is a lingering fear that the struggles of American companies may be pointing the way. \u201cThe heads of the large corporations have their fingers on a lot of information,\u201d said Bernard F. McGinn, president of McGinn Investment Management. \u201cThe decisions they make are of a scale many times what the consumer does.\u201d A case in point is DuPont, the chemical maker, which said Tuesday it would eliminate 1,500 jobs. Dow Chemical disclosed plans to cut 2,400 workers, or 5 percent of its global work force, and trim $500 million in costs as it copes with what the company called a \u201cslow-growth environment in the near-term.\u201d The growth in corporate profits of the last few years had been forecast to ebb in the latest quarter. But sales have been unexpectedly weak, and those correlate closely with customer demand. As of Tuesday, 91 of 145 big companies that had reported quarterly results said revenue was below analysts\u2019 expectations, according to Thomson Reuters. The weakest link in the global chain has been Europe. The deepest fears of a collapse in the euro appear to have receded since the European Central Bank indicated in July that it would step in to support the Continent\u2019s weaker economies. Now, attention has shifted to the protracted recession that some parts of Europe appear to be entering. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/24\/business\/energy-environment\/us-energy-policy-caught-in-the-vise-of-economics-and-politics.html","body":"\u201cDRILL, baby, drill.\u201d It is among the best-remembered lines of the 2008 presidential campaign, colorfully capturing the desire of many Americans for cheap, reliable energy produced at home rather than in unpredictable places like Iran or Venezuela.No slogan in the current presidential campaign has emerged to match it, but energy has taken center stage again as an issue that encompasses concerns about the environment and national security, and now, even more pressingly, economic revival. Presidential campaigns have a way of producing stark contrasts between candidates. In the presidential debates, President Obama and Mitt Romney clashed sharply on fossil fuels and renewable energy. The Republican nominee accused the president of picking a lot of losers with $90 billion worth of government largess for Solyndra, the California solar company, and other green enterprises. \u201cAnd by the way, I like coal,\u201d he said in the first debate. Mr. Obama countered that the oil industry was the true recipient of \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d in tax breaks: \u201cDoes anybody think Exxon Mobil needs some extra money, when they\u2019re making money every time you go to the pump?\u201d But such differences may be more rhetorical than real; the marketplace, technological change and Middle East tensions are driving Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney to much the same place on the country\u2019s energy future. Both candidates say they support nuclear power and biofuels, though neither is advocating strongly for either. Both say they want to encourage more oil drilling in places like North Dakota, Texas and Alaska to lower dependence on oil from the Middle East. Even while the current administration\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency has more aggressively regulated mining and drilling, Mr. Obama, like Mr. Romney, has celebrated the boom in domestic natural gas production and wants to spread its use for power production and even export. In a twist few would have predicted when Mr. Obama first entered the White House and much as it may dismay him, fossil fuels have eclipsed renewable energy and climate change in the national discussion \u2014 even as climate scientists warn that the droughts that scorch corn crops and the faster melting of Arctic ice and glaciers around the world are signs of things to come. \u201cLast time we were electing a president, it looked like we were running out of energy, and this time we\u2019re debating how to use what now seems to be ample resources for decades to come,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian. \u201cThe country needs to decide the pace and scale of domestic energy development as well as the mix among oil, natural gas, coal, renewable and nuclear we will use. But the marketplace itself will have a bigger role than the election campaign in what the mix eventually will be.\u201d The oil and shale gas drilling boom is reshaping the nation\u2019s energy map, and it is still difficult to predict the extent of its ramifications. With domestic oil production climbing rapidly since 2008, oil imports have been cut to just over 40 percent of domestic supplies, the lowest level in two decades, from 60 percent. Over the same period, domestic natural gas production has risen by 15 percent, producing a glut that has forced down the gas price by nearly two-thirds. Plentiful, cheap natural gas has crowded out much of the expected growth of renewable energy like wind and solar power, but it has cut domestic consumption of dirtier coal even more sharply. Electrical generation from wind, solar, geothermal and biomass have expanded to 5.8 percent of the country\u2019s electricity, from 3.1 percent, since Mr. Obama took office, partly because of tax incentives and other support from the administration\u2019s stimulus package. But the expansion of power driven by natural gas has arguably been even more impressive. Cheap natural gas fuels a bit more than 30 percent of American power production, up from just over 20 percent in 2008. On the stump, Mr. Obama has not been shy in heralding the boom in domestic oil and gas drilling under his watch. Not to be outdone, Mr. Romney has put \u201cenergy independence\u201d \u2014 including the expansion of hydrocarbon exploration and production, building the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada and removing federal regulations on coal \u2014 at the top of his five-point plan to produce millions of jobs. Certainly the two have different energy visions. Mr. Romney\u2019s proposal to expand state regulatory control over drilling and mining on federal lands would represent a break from government policies dating back to Theodore Roosevelt, in the highly unlikely event that Congress could be coaxed to go along. And the two candidates are on opposite sides of a gaping divide over coal, with Mr. Obama pushing to phase out coal-fired electrical generation while Mr. Romney favors burning more coal to keep mine operations rolling. But how much does the nation\u2019s energy future depend on who wins the race? No doubt the nation has several important decisions to make in the next couple of years. Should it limit hydraulic fracturing, the contentious method of blasting water through tight rocks to gain access to oil and gas, with new regulations? Should the federal government aggressively open up more offshore drilling in Alaska\u2019s Arctic and off the coasts of Virginia and the Carolinas? Should it export vast amounts of its new bounty of natural gas, potentially jeopardizing the low price that is currently benefiting domestic consumers and manufacturers? Should the country allow construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would secure oil supplies from Canada, but also guarantee the spread of mining for oil sands, which has a higher carbon footprint than most conventional oils? Does coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, have a future in America? Either Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney will have to decide along with, of course, the new Congress and in many cases the states. The two candidates and their parties have different constituencies that are tugging them in opposite directions on these questions. But the election will probably matter only on the margins of energy policy. The same cannot necessarily be said, however, about the flip side of energy policy \u2014 environmental policy \u2014 where a Romney Environmental Protection Administration would probably look very different from Mr. Obama\u2019s. 1 2 3 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/24\/us\/politics\/a-tight-focus-on-battleground-states-as-campaigning-time-dwindles.html","body":"DAYTON, Ohio \u2014 President Obama started making his closing argument for a second term on Tuesday, beginning a furious two-week effort to beat back a late surge by Mitt Romney and hang on to battleground states where voters are already casting ballots in large numbers.At the beginning of what the campaign described as a round-the-clock blitz, and on the day after his final debate, Mr. Obama tried to address what polling has shown is a consistent question among voters: What kind of agenda does he have for a second term? He released a 20-page booklet encapsulating previously announced policies and contrasting his positions to those of Mr. Romney. The document contains no new proposals, and was derided by a spokesman for Mr. Romney as a \u201cglossy panic button.\u201d But along with a new television advertisement that began running in nine battleground states, the president\u2019s aides predicted it would help counter the Romney assault plan for the next two weeks that aims to convince voters that Mr. Obama has no plans to fix the ailing economy. Mr. Romney and his campaign spent Tuesday pounding away at points Mr. Romney made during the debate on Monday night, including accusing the president of apologizing for the United States and cutting military spending excessively. Mr. Romney flew from Florida to Nevada, where he mocked Mr. Obama\u2019s attacks on him as desperate moves by a losing candidate. \u201cYou know, the truth is that attacks on me are not an agenda,\u201d Mr. Romney said to a crowd of about 6,000 people in Henderson, Nev. \u201cHis is a status quo candidacy. His is a message of going forward with the same policies of the last four years, and that\u2019s why his campaign is slipping, and that\u2019s why ours is gaining so much steam.\u201d In the president\u2019s minute-long ad, and in appearances at the start of a frenetic week, Mr. Obama stepped up his effort to convince the nation that he had brought it back from the brink of economic collapse and that Mr. Romney would embrace the policies that caused the problems. Looking directly into the camera, the president asks voters to \u201cread my plan, compare it to Governor Romney\u2019s and decide which is better for you.\u201d But even as he sought to strike a positive note at the start of a three-day swing that is taking him through Ohio, Iowa, Colorado, Nevada, Florida and Virginia, Mr. Obama also enthusiastically stepped up his attacks. The Republican candidate, the president said at a rally in Florida, wants to \u201cturn back the clock 50 years for immigrants and gays and women\u201d and is pursuing a foreign policy that is \u201call over the map.\u201d Appearing later with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at a raucous rally before 9,500 people in Dayton, the president went into a spirited assault, using his new favorite attack word \u2014 \u201cRomnesia\u201d \u2014 to highlight his rival\u2019s position on the auto bailout, which the White House says was vital to saving jobs in Ohio and throughout the Midwest. \u201cLast night, Governor Romney looked me right in the eye, tried to pretend he never said, \u2018Let Detroit go bankrupt,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Obama said, one of many instances all day when he suggested Mr. Romney was not being honest about his positions as he seeks to appeal to a general-election audience after a Republican primary campaign in which he emphasized conservative stances. With some polls suggesting that Mr. Romney is closing the gap, Mr. Obama\u2019s top strategists described twin approaches: to make final appeals to independents, moderates, women and minorities as they offer lacerating assessments of Mr. Romney\u2019s qualifications and credibility. Still, Mr. Obama\u2019s schedule and the tenor of his campaign appearances made clear that his primary mission now was to energize his own supporters and get them to vote, preferably right away. In Florida, where he appeared in the morning, and later in Ohio,the constant refrain at his rallies was \u201cVote! Vote! Vote!\u201d Early voting begins in Florida on Saturday and is already under way in Ohio.The terrain that Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney are covering this week illustrates a battleground within a battleground. The campaigns are advertising in nine states \u2014 stretching from North Carolina to Nevada \u2014 but are spending most of their most crucial resource \u2014 their time \u2014 in the Midwest. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb Ashley Parker contributed reporting from Henderson, Nev., Jeff Zeleny from Columbus, Ohio, and Jim Rutenberg and Erik Eckholm from New York."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/24\/opinion\/patents-and-technology.html","body":"To the Editor:\u201cIn the High-Tech Patent Wars, an Inventor\u2019s Lament\u201d (Bits blog, Oct. 15) conflates perceived concerns about our patent system and hand-wringing about some high-profile lawsuits to conclude that innovation is threatened. Nothing is further from the truth. For more than two centuries, American patent laws have supported innovations that made us the world leader in breakthrough ideas and technologies. While no system is perfect, we must avoid the urge to \u201cfix\u201d marginal imperfections with hammers rather than tweezers. The misguided focus on the so-called smartphone war is a case in point. History is full of patent disputes involving novel inventions, from the cotton gin to the sewing machine to Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s telephone. In each case the litigation abated, technology survived, often improved, and lives were made richer. The shift to mobile technology that is defining the 21st century is supported by research and development investment motivated and protected by strong patent laws. We should not overreact or encourage regulation aimed at limiting inventors\u2019 ability to enforce the fundamental property right contemplated by our Constitution. Given the state of global competition, and an economy increasingly dependent on knowledge and innovation, we must preserve incentives to invent, not diminish them. DONALD J.

He agreed on almost everything and applauded Mr. Obama for many foreign policy achievements. The question is, Can we trust this cheerleader, whose advisers include a good number of neoconservatives? Is he not a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing? And if Mr. Obama\u2019s policies are so good, why would we want to replace him with Mr. Romney? ALEXANDER SOIFER Colorado Springs, Oct. 23, 2012 To the Editor: Mitt Romney held his own, and more, in the debate with President Obama regarding foreign policy and the need for a strong economy and military to resolve America\u2019s failing leadership in the world. He did not stoop to childish jabs as the president did, nor did he embarrass the president over his deadly failure to protect his ambassador and three other Americans from a terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. Mr. Romney demonstrated a presidential command of the knowledge, concern and solutions needed, while President Obama poses the threat of American military and economic weakness. DANIEL B. JEFFS Apple Valley, Calif., Oct. 23, 2012 To the Editor: It looked to me as if this last presidential debate was the exact opposite of the first debate. This time it looked as if Mitt Romney was asleep. The debate was officially about foreign policy, which is where Mr. Romney is weak. President Obama kept hitting Mr. Romney on contradictions, and Mr. Romney failed to respond. Mr. Romney also had a last chance to finally reveal the specifics of his plans for the economy, and he failed to do so. MARC PERKEL Gilroy, Calif., Oct. 23, 2012 To the Editor: The core idea in \u201cThe Opiate of Exceptionalism\u201d (news analysis, Sunday Review, Oct. 21) was corroborated by the presidential debate on foreign policy. Americans need, and want, to continue to believe that they are an \u201cexceptional\u201d nation, a special people. If there was one thing both presidential candidates agreed on, it was that America has to lead, has to expand its influence worldwide, as well as exert its will, for achieving a better world. Mitt Romney was more adamant in this respect, with his Hollywood-style belief that America should take up the mantle of world leadership, and be honored to do so. Yet President Obama seemed to be on the same page. Sadly, it all sounds like a 21st-century version of the 19th-century British imperialist and supremacist rhetoric. ANDREA CHIOVENDA Jalalabad, Afghanistan, Oct. 23, 2012 The writer, a Ph.D. candidate in anthropology at Boston University, is conducting ethnographic fieldwork in Afghanistan. To the Editor: In \u201cPresidential Mitt\u201d (column, Oct. 21), Bill Keller wrote that if Mitt Romney is elected, \u201che will be hostage to the same far-right forces he kowtowed to in the primaries.\u201d That, in a nutshell, is a central concern of many. Undoubtedly Mr. Romney has learned the lessons from the first President Bush not to renege on the principles and promises that helped him secure the nomination (\u201cread my lips ...\u201d). Equally likely, if elected he will try mightily to prove his conservative bona fides to the Republican base. Any such strategy will be a surefire prescription to repeat some of the disastrous and wrongheaded policies of the second President Bush. LEE A. SPIELMANN New York, Oct. 23, 2012 To the Editor: This season\u2019s debates proved one thing: the format is outmoded and this TV show should be canceled. Changing moderators is just a cast change. The actors have learned their lines and studied their roles. The lost live TV news conference should be reinstated and required for the next presidential election season. FRANCIS W.
