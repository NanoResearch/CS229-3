[{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/euro-avoids-collapse-but-its-future-remains-uncertain.html","body":"Remember the euro crisis?Only a few months ago, it was front-page news. Would the euro collapse? Would most of southern Europe go broke, unable to borrow money at any reasonable rate? Would that bring on a new world recession? But in this week\u2019s foreign policy debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney, the euro never came up. Europe was mentioned once, but the reference had nothing to do with economics. Mr. Romney did refer to Greece, but only to say we were in danger of going down the same path if we did not change our ways. To a surprising extent, the perception seems to be that the European situation is under control. That is true if all you worry about is whether bondholders will get paid. It is false if you have a broader perspective. The focus of the last couple of years on borrowing costs for peripheral members of the euro zone was, in retrospect, unfortunate. It was always clear that Europe, as a whole, had the ability to solve that issue if it wished to do so. The European Central Bank, like the United States Federal Reserve, has the ability to print money, and that is what it finally did. But the real issue was \u2014 and remains \u2014 whether the peripheral countries could turn into successful economies while staying in the euro zone. On that issue, progress is painfully slow. \u201cThe actions of the E.C.B. and other policy makers in Europe have generally had the effect of filling large financial gaps in periphery bank and sovereign funding,\u201d wrote Bob Prince of Bridgewater Associates this week, \u201cbut have done relatively little to resolve competitive imbalances among these economies.\u201d Banks are hesitant to lend. On Thursday, the European Central Bank report on loan activity in September showed a record 1.4 percent year-over-year decline in loans outstanding to private sector companies and individuals in the euro zone. \u201cThese numbers are rather consistent with the bleak picture painted by business surveys, showing an ongoing contraction of activity,\u201d wrote Fran\u00e7ois Cabau and Phillippe Gudin of Barclays Capital in a note to clients. If peripheral countries simply had fixed exchange rates, rather than a common currency, they could and almost certainly would have devalued their currencies long before now. That is the normal prescription for countries in financial distress. Couple it with austerity and revivals can be surprisingly rapid, as exports surge and imports plunge. As it is, the process is sure to be long and painful, but not certain to succeed. As Europe stumbles and slows, there has been a temptation in the United States to turn our attention elsewhere, to Asia for economic reasons and to the Mideast for political ones. Mr. Romney has tried to add South America to that mix. But neither the Romney nor Obama campaign has wanted to talk much about Europe, a fact that has been noted with a little alarm in Europe. Richard Lambert, the chancellor of Britain\u2019s Warwick University \u2014 and a former editor of The Financial Times as well as a former central banker \u2014 was in New York this week trying to convince Americans that they should care, and predicting that the euro will survive. \u201cThe European Union has the capacity to get its affairs into order, if it has the political determination to do so,\u201d he said in a speech at New York University. \u201cThis is a crisis about economic imbalances within the euro zone, more than it is about fault lines with the rest of the world.\u201d That is a point worth remembering. The euro zone as a whole is running smaller budget and current account deficits than is the United States. If it were one country, there might be articles about depressed regions, but not talk of collapse. But it is not one country. It is taking halting steps in that direction, with a move to unified bank supervision, but political union is not going to happen; Angela Merkel\u2019s name is never going to be on a ballot outside of Germany. Nor is there going to be easy labor mobility around Europe, even though that is supposedly guaranteed now. Cultural and language differences assure that. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com\/economix."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/us\/david-dewhurst-gives-lawmakers-and-lobbyists-a-little-extra.html","body":"Ross Ramsey, the executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.Membership really does have its privileges. When Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst sped up the legislative schedule \u2014 naming Senate committee chairmen now instead of waiting until after the session starts in January \u2014 he gave the new leaders a little something extra. Mr. Dewhurst did the same for people with business before the Legislature. Those two camps can get a head start on building their relationships. In three months, you might even be able to put a number on it. In the normal order of things, Texas voters elect their legislators in November during even-numbered years, then those legislators convene in January of every odd-numbered year following the elections for a 20-week regular session. Several weeks into those sessions \u2014 often, in February \u2014 the leaders of the two legislative bodies \u2014 the House speaker and the lieutenant governor \u2014 organize members into the committees that will handle various subjects, like budgets, public schools, prisons and economic development. Mr. Dewhurst, fresh off a stinging and personally expensive loss in the race for the Republican nomination for United States Senate, is getting his political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 back together \u2014 mainly by putting his nose to the grindstone and returning to State Senate business. He will be working in front of a different Senate this time, one with at least six new members, a number of whom are more conservative than the people they are replacing. Among his moves, he put Dan Patrick, Republican of Houston \u2014 an advocate of taxpayer-backed vouchers for private schools \u2014 in charge of the Public Education Committee. He named Tommy Williams, Republican of The Woodlands, to fill the empty chairmanship of the budget-writing Finance Committee. He removed Judith Zaffirini, Democrat of Laredo, from her post as chairwoman of the Higher Education Committee, installing her on the less prestigious Government Organization Committee. The thing to note here is the timing. To keep up appearances and to avoid the impression of any direct pay-for-play governing, lawmakers aren\u2019t allowed to raise money while they\u2019re in regular session, and for the 30 days leading up to a legislative session or during the 20 days that follow one. As a practical matter, that means lawmakers, donors, lobbyists and their various ilk don\u2019t exactly know before the contribution blackout who will be doing what. They often have a fair idea, but without certainty. If, say, somebody has been the head of the Senate State Affairs Committee for a while, like Robert Duncan, Republican of Lubbock, has, there is a good chance he will be in that spot or in an even better one in the future. (In fact, that happened: he will remain in that post.) Experts and reliable allies tend to stay in place. But this is a year of heavy legislative turnover. At least half a dozen senators aren\u2019t coming back, leaving some big positions open. Mr. Dewhurst\u2019s shuffle put almost a dozen senators in chairmanships they did not hold before. He can always fiddle with it later, and he hasn\u2019t announced which senators will populate those committees, but the leadership appears to be set. That blackout on campaign contributions doesn\u2019t happen until December. And only one Senate seat is truly in play in the November elections. Even if they wait until after the elections, the lobby, the interests, the fund-raising and campaign consultants, and the candidates all have time to get together, to build their relationships, to talk about the issues. And to raise money. Not to pick on Ms. Zaffirini, but she provides an easy example of what to expect. Her new committee will oversee \u201csunset bills\u201d that have to pass for various agencies to stay in business. The policy idea is that those agencies won\u2019t survive without continued legislative approval, which is given in 12-year doses. One of the agencies on this year\u2019s list is the Texas Railroad Commission which, in spite of its name, regulates the oil and gas business. That industry is booming right now, with hydraulic fracturing hot spots like the one in the Eagle Ford Shale, a formation that significantly overlaps Ms. Zaffirini\u2019s Senate district. More important, it overlaps the business of the committee she has just been named to lead. What appeared to be a slight from the lieutenant governor could be a boon instead. She\u2019s got a bunch of new friends, and time to build relationships and raise money. rramsey@texastribune.org"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/us\/politics\/obama-and-romney-raise-1-billion-each.html","body":"President Obama and Mitt Romney are both on pace to raise more than $1 billion with their parties by Election Day, according to financial disclosures filed by the campaigns on Thursday.From the beginning of 2011 through Oct. 17, Mr. Obama and the Democrats raised about $1.06 billion, and Mr. Romney and the Republicans collected $954 million, including some money for the party\u2019s Congressional efforts, setting up 2012 to be the most expensive presidential campaign in history. But the sources of that money, raised over the course of a deeply polarizing campaign, echo the sharp divisions between the two men and their parties over issues like abortion rights, the role of government in regulating industry and the country\u2019s economic future. Wall Street has invested more heavily in Mr. Romney, a former financier who has pledged to repeal Mr. Obama\u2019s new financial regulations, than in any presidential candidate in memory. Employees of financial firms had given more than $18 million dollars to Mr. Romney\u2019s campaign through the end of September and tens of millions more to the \u201csuper PACs\u201d supporting him. Insurance companies, doctors and law, accounting and real estate firms are giving less to Mr. Obama and the Democratic National Committee than they did four years ago, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Yet donors in other industries have stepped in. With Mr. Obama making repeated trips to Silicon Valley and holding round tables with executives there, the technology industry has donated about $14 million to the president and the Democrats, substantially more than in 2008. Retirees, the biggest single source of money for both sides, have given the Democrats much more than they did four years ago, as have employees of women\u2019s groups, retailers and hospitals and nursing homes. To make up for the loss of business money that flowed to his campaign four years ago, Mr. Obama has also turned to the very smallest donors, building an army of millions of supporters who have given as little as a few dollars each. About 4.2 million people sent donations to Mr. Obama and the D.N.C., his campaign said on Thursday, roughly one million more than in 2008. Over all, 55 percent of the Obama campaign\u2019s money through the end of September came in donations of less than $200, including from many people who have repeatedly sent in small checks over the course of the campaign. Just 13 percent of his checks were for $2,500, the maximum that donors are allowed to contribute for either the primary or general election. Mr. Romney, by contrast, has cultivated business leaders and benefited from a Republican donor establishment that is eager to defeat Mr. Obama, raising an unprecedented amount of money from wealthy donors who gave the maximum allowed. Just 22 percent of his cash has come from donations of less than $200. Through the end of September, 45 percent of checks to Mr. Romney\u2019s campaign were for the maximum $2,500 contribution. Neither candidate is likely to raise as much money directly for his own presidential committee as Mr. Obama did in 2008. A flood of online donations that year, and support from many traditionally Republican donors, helped Mr. Obama raise $748 million for his presidential committee. The D.N.C. raised another $244 million, bringing the combined total to a little under $1 billion. This time around, Mr. Obama, as an incumbent, has raised more of his total through the D.N.C., which can accept five-figure checks from each of Mr. Obama\u2019s wealthiest supporters. By raising more money from his very biggest and very smallest donors, Mr. Obama has been able to offset his losses from the business world and from previous contributors who gave less or not at all this time, whether because of the recession or fading enthusiasm. Mr. Romney, after becoming the presumptive Republican nominee in the spring, almost immediately began a fund-raising effort with the Republican National Committee, several state parties and the two Congressional campaign committees. Mr. Romney\u2019s total through September included about $13.6 million that was raised for and transferred to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee. The overall totals do not include hundreds of millions of dollars being raised and spent by \u201csuper PACs\u201d and other outside groups, mostly to benefit Mr. Romney and other Republicans. Groups aligned with Mr. Romney have spent $302 million on campaign advertising that they are required to disclose to the F.E.C., compared with about $120 million for groups aligned with Mr. Obama. Tens of millions of dollars more has been spent on issue advertisements whose precise costs are difficult to measure. \u201cAs the Romney campaign and their \u2018super PAC\u2019 allies continue to outspend us on the air, we\u2019re making every effort to expand our donor base heading into the final stretch,\u201d said Adam Fetcher, an Obama spokesman. Mr. Romney and the Republicans raised about $21.3 million more than Mr. Obama and the Democrats during the first 17 days of October, according to the disclosures filed on Thursday, as Mr. Romney rose in the polls and performed well in debates, emboldening his supporters. Mr. Obama and the Democratic National Committee took in $92.4 million during that period, after surpassing Mr. Romney in August and September. Mr. Romney and the R.N.C. raised $113.7 million over the same period, the final days for which the campaigns are required to report their fund-raising before the election on Nov. 6. Mr. Romney and his party also spent about $146.2 million during the first 17 days in October, slightly less than the $149.7 million spent by Mr. Obama and the Democrats. While Mr. Obama\u2019s team invested tens of millions of dollars early in the campaign to identify, contact and raise money from grass-roots voters, those expenditures have left the Republicans with more cash in the final weeks of the election that could finance a late surge of advertising. Mr. Romney and the G.O.P. ended the final filing period with $169 million in cash on hand, significantly more than the $123.8 million held by Mr. Obama and the Democrats.

He then stayed on the run for more than a dozen years until he was finally killed in 2011 in a shootout at a security checkpoint in Somalia.He was Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, a Qaeda leader in East Africa and, it turns out, the author of an autobiography that is now playing a role in a terrorism case in Federal District Court in Manhattan. \u201cThe main principle of our work in Kenya was to remain covert,\u201d Mr. Mohammed wrote in one excerpt quoted in court papers. In another passage, he said, \u201cI worked hard on the new Kenyan and Tanzanian brothers to raise their morale and to clarify the fundamentals of jihad in their minds.\u201d In yet another section, Mr. Mohammed told how he stayed alive, given his clandestine mission, by moving to a house whose location was not known to anyone, including to fellow operatives. \u201cSeverance of all associations with previous places and colleagues is my successful way to survive in my line of work,\u201d he wrote. The original Arabic version of the autobiography was posted on a jihadi Web site for a time in 2009, said Nelly Lahoud, a senior associate at the Combating Terrorism Center at the United States Military Academy at West Point, whose study about the document was published by the center in June. \u201cIt is a unique find,\u201d she said Thursday. \u201cThis is the richest internal source we have of Al Qaeda\u2019s inner workings and political culture.\u201d Excerpts from an English translation, which is said to run 220 pages, were filed on Wednesday evening in federal court by lawyers for another Qaeda figure, Wadih El-Hage, a naturalized American citizen from Lebanon who had worked as a close aide to Osama bin Laden. Mr. El-Hage, who was convicted in 2001 in Manhattan of terrorism conspiracy, was depicted by prosecutors as a dangerous operative, privy to Bin Laden\u2019s secrets and adept at carrying his messages. But many of the excerpts cited by his lawyers show Mr. Mohammed complaining, almost whining at times, about Mr. El-Hage, who was once his boss in Nairobi, where the East Africa Qaeda cell was based. By Mr. Mohammed\u2019s account, Mr. El-Hage appeared more interested in making money buying and selling precious stones, even at the risk of revealing the cell\u2019s mission. \u201cI advised Wadih to stop the trading because it will expose our real activities,\u201d Mr. Mohammed wrote. \u201cBut Wadih used to say that the brothers do not support us with our daily life expenses, and he needed to trade in order to make a living.\u201d Mr. El-Hage\u2019s lawyers, Joshua L. Dratel and Sam A. Schmidt, make it clear that they want to use the writings by Mr. Mohammed, who also was known as Haroun, to show that Mr. El-Hage was not as culpable in the conspiracy as the government contended and should be granted some leniency when he is resentenced. (Mr. El-Hage\u2019s conviction was upheld on appeal but his life sentence was vacated.) But prosecutors sharply disagree with these arguments, according to a letter to Judge Lewis A. Kaplan that is part of the filing. In the letter, two prosecutors contend that \u201cthe Haroun autobiography thoroughly inculpates\u201d Mr. El-Hage. They cite passages in which Mr. Mohammed described Mr. El-Hage traveling to Sudan to meet with Bin Laden and his being \u201cin charge of finance\/administration\u201d of the terrorist cell."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/transcript-of-1944-bretton-woods-meeting-found-at-treasury.html","body":"WASHINGTON \u2014 A Treasury economist rummaging in the department\u2019s library has stumbled on a historical treasure hiding in plain sight: a transcript of the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 that cast the foundations of the modern international monetary system.Historians had never known that a transcript existed for the event held in the heat of World War II, when delegates from 44 allied nations fighting Hitler gathered in the mountains of New Hampshire to create the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But there were three copies in archives and libraries around Washington that had never been made public, until now. \u201cIt\u2019s as if someone handed us Madison\u2019s notes on the debate over the Constitution,\u201d said Eric Rauchway, a historian the University of California, Davis. Economic historians who have viewed the transcript say it adds color and detail to the historical record, an already thick one given the many contemporaneous and subsequent accounts of Bretton Woods. The transcript seems to contain no great surprises, but it sheds light on the intense debates as the war raged abroad. It depicts John Maynard Keynes, the British economist, hurrying to marshal support for the broad agreements on international finance. It underscores the tremendous power then wielded by Britain and, especially, the United States. It also shows the seeds of contemporary disputes being sown. For instance, seven decades ago, a number of poorer or smaller countries were protesting their International Monetary Fund quotas, which determine power in the fund. Many of those countries, including China and India, are still pushing for more influence today. In one section of the transcript, an American representative lays out a proposal for apportioning power in the fund and underscores what was at stake, with the war coming to its bloody climax in Europe. \u201cWe fight together on sodden battlefields. We sail together on the majestic blue. We fly together in the ethereal sky,\u201d said Fred M. Vinson, who later became chief justice of the United States. \u201cThe test of this conference is whether we can walk together, solve our economic problems, down the road to peace as we today march to victory.\u201d But the response was not one of absolute unity. \u201cIn spite of the very eloquent and moving speech of the United States delegate, on behalf of the Iranian delegation I wish to state that the quota proposed for my country is entirely unsatisfactory,\u201d a delegate from Tehran responded. Then, a delegate from China added: \u201cI hesitate greatly to sound a note of discord at this conference. It has been the effort of the Chinese delegation to promote harmony and the success of this great common enterprise. But every delegation has its difficulties.\u201d The Netherlands, Greece, Australia, India, Yugoslavia, New Zealand, France, Ethiopia, Norway and Britain then added their comments and objections. \u201cI think that a lot of people have thought of Bretton Woods as being a stitch-up job between United Kingdom and the United States,\u201d Mr. Rauchway said. \u201cBut that\u2019s overstated, and it\u2019s definitely visible in this transcript. You can see the poorer countries fighting their own corner.\u201d Kurt Schuler a Treasury Department economist, was browsing in an \u201cout of the way\u201d section of uncataloged material in the library two years ago when he came across the Bretton Woods document. He flipped through and saw some remarks by Keynes that he was not familiar with, sort of the economists\u2019 equivalent of a Bob Dylan fan finding unknown lyrics. \u201cI checked them against Keynes\u2019s collected works,\u201d Mr. Schuler said. \u201cAnd I knew I had something.\u201d His research revealed that there were three copies of the transcript that scores of economic historians were not aware of: the version at the Treasury Department; one in the National Archives; and the third in the International Monetary Fund archives. In his spare time, Mr. Schuler set about turning the yellowed transcript into a book, with a co-editor, Andrew Rosenberg. It took a tremendous amount of work, Mr. Schuler said. They read the transcript aloud into transcription software. They added hyperlinks to documents referenced at the conference, and wrote summaries, annotations and historical notes. This week, the polished transcript was published as an 800-page e-book by the Center for Financial Stability, a nonprofit group based in New York that researches financial markets, where Mr. Schuler is a senior fellow and Mr. Rosenberg a research associate. \u201cEveryone thinks they know what happened at Bretton Woods, but what they know has been filtered by generations of historical accounts,\u201d Barry Eichengreen, a professor or economics and political science at the University of California, Berkeley, said in a statement. \u201cInternational monetary history will never be the same.\u201d The transcript provides \u201cinsight in how it was that they were able to maintain a pace of work which allowed them to reach two really big agreements, on the I.M.F. and the World Bank, within a space of three weeks,\u201d Mr. Schuler said. \u201cKeynes was something of a task master,\u201d he added. Benn Steil, a senior fellow and director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, said readers can see the British Empire \u201cdisintegrating before your eyes,\u201d in the transcript. \u201cThe Indians are so vociferous that the British are ripping them off. The British are both furious and mortified that their colony would do this to them,\u201d he said, describing a dispute over debts with the colonies. \u201cBretton Woods was itself 95 percent Kabuki theater,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s interesting Kabuki theater.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/citing-lack-of-women-in-top-jobs-european-parliament-rejects-male-nominee.html","body":"BRUSSELS \u2014 Asserting that it was fed up with only men in top jobs, the European Parliament on Thursday narrowly rejected the nomination of Yves Mersch to the executive board of the European Central Bank.The Parliament does not have the power to require that women be considered, and governments still could approve the nomination of Mr. Mersch to a post that has been vacant for months even as the region\u2019s sovereign debt crisis rumbles on. But if they still go ahead with the nomination, governments would pit themselves against the only directly elected body in the European Union over the diplomatically fragile issue of promoting gender balance. They also would be defying a majority of the Parliament during a period of heightened concern about making European institutions like the central bank more democratically accountable. The vote took place at a full session of the Parliament in Strasbourg, France, where 325 members voted against the appointment, 300 voted in favor and 49 abstained. The Parliament must be consulted on nominations to the E.C.B. board, but its \u00a0opinion does not bind governments.\u00a0 In a statement, the Parliament said its members had rejected putting \u201cmen only\u201d at the central bank, and it noted that governments had shown \u201cintransigence in failing to commit to a better gender balance within what is effectively Europe\u2019s most powerful financial institution.\u201d The motivations behind such a high-profile vote were probably more complex. Some members seeking a greater \u00a0role for the Parliament may have seen \u00a0an opportunity to challenge the power \u00a0that governments still exercise over the\u00a0European Union.\u00a0 Other members may have been expressing dislike of some of Mr. Mersch\u2019s \u00a0economic ideas \u2014 in particular a wariness of inflation. \u00a0And some may continue to be \u00a0miffed that a northern European, rather \u00a0than a representative from southern \u00a0Europe, had been selected to replace Jos\u00e9 Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez-P\u00e1ramo of \u00a0Spain, whose term expired on May 31. Mr. Mersch, the head of the central \u00a0bank of Luxembourg, is known for his \u00a0hawkish stance on inflation. He was \u00a0nominated by euro area finance ministers in July. Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, which represents the European Union\u2019s leaders, told the Parliament on Tuesday that Mr. Mersch\u2019s appointment should proceed based on his professional qualifications and experience. Mr. Van Rompuy also said he had asked the union\u2019s member governments to suggest more female candidates in the future. But Mr. Van Rompuy\u2019s appeal did little to sway the opinion of some of the Parliament\u2019s most influential members, including Sharon Bowles, a British member who heads the economic and monetary affairs committee. \u201cMr. Van Rompuy has not taken the opportunity to offer more than lip service to what is a very serious matter,\u201d Ms. Bowles said after the vote on Thursday. \u201cHe has promised nothing, not even a road map, for appointing women to the E.C.B. board in the future.\u201d Ms. Bowles said two years had gone by without an adequate response from governments on the lack of female candidates. A spokesman for Mr. Van Rompuy said that he had no immediate comment on the outcome. A spokesman for the Luxembourg central bank said on Thursday that Mr. Mersch had no comment at this stage. Sven Giegold, a member from Germany and a spokesman on economic and monetary affairs for the Greens group, said after the vote that there had been no women on the board since 2011, when Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell of Austria left the board at the end of an eight-year term. Mr. Giegold noted that there were no female presidents of European central banks. \u201cWith no change anticipated on the E.C.B. board before 2018, this means that women will be excluded from the euro zone\u2019s highest decision-making bodies for the near future,\u201d said Mr. Giegold, who called on Mr. Mersch to withdraw his candidacy. Hannes Swoboda, an Austrian member who is the president of the group of Socialists and Democrats, said in a Facebook chat after the vote that the Parliament could not stop the nomination of Mr. Mersch. But he warned that lawmakers would see it \u201cas a seriously unfriendly act.\u201d This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: October 26, 2012An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a possible motivation for opposition in the European Parliament to Yves Mersch\u2019s nomination at the European Central Bank.

By acting forcefully to address its problems there, Ford is setting a bold example for the rest of the industry, analysts said. Other companies will face pressure to make similar moves or explain to investors why they are continuing to employ too many workers at underused factories. Ford is following the same blueprint to downsize in Europe that it used to turn around its North American business several years ago. The company said Thursday that it expected to lose more than $1.5 billion in Europe this year, up from an earlier estimate of at least $1 billion. Ford said the cuts would save about $500 million in annual costs, and help it return to profitability in the region by mid-decade. Ford\u2019s chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said the automaker was working with its unions in Belgium and Britain to assist workers affected by the factory closings. \u201cWe recognize the impact our actions will have on many employees and their families in Europe, and we will work together with all stakeholders during this necessary transformation of our business,\u201d he said in a conference call with analysts and reporters. Ford had said Wednesday that it would close its assembly plant in Genk, Belgium, by the end of 2014. On Thursday, it said it would also close two plants in Southampton and Dagenham in Britain next year. The actions will reduce production capacity in Europe by 18 percent, or 355,000 vehicles. The company said it would eliminate 4,300 positions in Belgium and 1,400 in Britain. The moves contrast with those of other automakers that have either avoided plant closings altogether, or scheduled shutdowns for several years from now. One industry analyst said other auto companies in Europe could follow Ford\u2019s lead and step up their restructuring efforts. \u201cThere is something to be said for swallowing all of the bad medicine at one time,\u201d said Michael Robinet, managing director of IHS Automotive Consulting in Northville, Mich. \u201cI think other manufacturers have to acknowledge a real sense of urgency now.\u201d European auto sales have fallen to a projected 14 million vehicles this year, down from about 18 million in 2008. Ford\u2019s European chief, Stephen Odell, said the market may drop even further next year, making production adjustments essential for a long-term turnaround on the Continent. \u201cIt\u2019s fairly evident there is surplus capacity across most manufacturers,\u201d Mr. Odell said. \u201cAt some point it has to be addressed.\u201d Renault underscored the gloom, saying Thursday that its third-quarter revenue fell 13.3 percent from a year earlier, to 8.45 billion euros ($11 billion). It warned that \u201cthe continuous deterioration of the European market remains a source of concern.\u201d Several automakers have pledged to reduce capacity in Europe, but actually closing plants has proved difficult. Since 2007, only three European auto plants have been closed: a Saab Automobile plant in Trollhattan, Sweden, which closed after the company collapsed; a General Motors factory in Antwerp, Belgium; and a Fiat plant in Termini, Italy. AlixPartners, a consulting firm, said that Europe was drowning in car factories, with 26 percent overcapacity, equivalent to seven million units in a shrinking market. Only 54 percent of Italian auto manufacturing capacity is being used, Alix estimated, and just 60 percent of French capacity. That contrasts with 89 percent capacity usage in Germany, where most of the region\u2019s strongest carmakers are based, and about 90 percent capacity usage in the United States. G.M. has been negotiating with union leaders to close its large Opel plant in Bochum, Germany, and has said it intends to end production there by 2016. The French automaker PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn had announced plans in July to close a plant in Aulnay-sous-Bois, near Paris, and to lay off 8,000 workers in France. But the company may find it politically challenging to proceed with those cuts after the French government announced on Wednesday that it would provide 7 billion euros in state credit guarantees to Peugeot\u2019s finance unit. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html","body":"BEIJING \u2014 The mother of China\u2019s prime minister was a schoolteacher in northern China. His father was ordered to tend pigs in one of Mao\u2019s political campaigns. And during childhood, \u201cmy family was extremely poor,\u201d the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, said in a speech last year.But now 90, the prime minister\u2019s mother, Yang Zhiyun, not only left poverty behind, she became outright rich, at least on paper, according to corporate and regulatory records. Just one investment in her name, in a large Chinese financial services company, had a value of $120 million five years ago, the records show. The details of how Ms. Yang, a widow, accumulated such wealth are not known, or even if she was aware of the holdings in her name. But it happened after her son was elevated to China\u2019s ruling elite, first in 1998 as vice prime minister and then five years later as prime minister. Many relatives of Wen Jiabao, including his son, daughter, younger brother and brother-in-law, have become extraordinarily wealthy during his leadership, an investigation by The New York Times shows. A review of corporate and regulatory records indicates that the prime minister\u2019s relatives \u2014 some of whom, including his wife, have a knack for aggressive deal making \u2014 have controlled assets worth at least $2.7 billion. In many cases, the names of the relatives have been hidden behind layers of partnerships and investment vehicles involving friends, work colleagues and business partners. Untangling their financial holdings provides an unusually detailed look at how politically connected people have profited from being at the intersection of government and business as state influence and private wealth converge in China\u2019s fast-growing economy. Unlike most new businesses in China, the family\u2019s ventures sometimes received financial backing from state-owned companies, including China Mobile, one of the country\u2019s biggest phone operators, the documents show. At other times, the ventures won support from some of Asia\u2019s richest tycoons. The Times found that Mr. Wen\u2019s relatives accumulated shares in banks, jewelers, tourist resorts, telecommunications companies and infrastructure projects, sometimes by using offshore entities. The holdings include a villa development project in Beijing; a tire factory in northern China; a company that helped build some of Beijing\u2019s Olympic stadiums, including the well-known \u201cBird\u2019s Nest\u201d; and Ping An Insurance, one of the world\u2019s biggest financial services companies. As prime minister in an economy that remains heavily state-driven, Mr. Wen, who is best known for his simple ways and common touch, more importantly has broad authority over the major industries where his relatives have made their fortunes. Chinese companies cannot list their shares on a stock exchange without approval from agencies overseen by Mr. Wen, for example. He also has the power to influence investments in strategic sectors like energy and telecommunications. Because the Chinese government rarely makes its deliberations public, it is not known what role \u2014 if any \u2014 Mr. Wen, who is 70, has played in most policy or regulatory decisions. But in some cases, his relatives have sought to profit from opportunities made possible by those decisions. The prime minister\u2019s younger brother, for example, has a company that was awarded more than $30 million in government contracts and subsidies to handle wastewater treatment and medical waste disposal for some of China\u2019s biggest cities, according to estimates based on government records. The contracts were announced after Mr. Wen ordered tougher regulations on medical waste disposal in 2003 after the SARS outbreak. In 2004, after the State Council, a government body Mr. Wen presides over, exempted Ping An Insurance and other companies from rules that limited their scope, Ping An went on to raise $1.8 billion in an initial public offering of stock. Partnerships controlled by Mr. Wen\u2019s relatives \u2014 along with their friends and colleagues \u2014 made a fortune by investing in the company before the public offering. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/arts\/spare-times-for-oct-26-nov-1.html","body":"Around TownMuseums and Sites Bartow-Pell Mansion Museum: Garden Cleanup and Cemetery Walk (Saturday) Early risers may want to dig right into the beautification of this mansion\u2019s garden, going on from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Participants should provide their own gardening gloves and sturdy shoes, but a free light breakfast will be available, courtesy of the mansion.

Millions of Romanians watched on television as Mr. Nastase, 62, was carried off on a stretcher, a Burberry scarf wrapped around his neck. He survived, and one week later was behind bars.But this is Romania, where everything, it seems, is a matter of dispute. Anti-corruption advocates hailed Mr. Nastase\u2019s downfall as a seminal moment in the evolution of a young democracy. Others have called his conviction for siphoning $2 million in state funds for his presidential campaign a show trial. Mr. Nastase\u2019s opponents now allege that he faked a suicide attempt in an effort to avoid prison. His son Andrei Nastase, who was at the house at the time, said the accusation was absurd. Whatever the truth, Adrian Nastase now occupies a cell measuring 4 square meters, or 43 square feet. On his jailhouse blog, he recently recounted how prisoners ate cabbage and potatoes, braved rats and had hot water for two hours twice a week. Today, analysts here and abroad say the Nastase case has come to reveal as much about Romania\u2019s political polarization and dysfunction as its halting steps toward greater democracy. It comes amid heightened fears in the European Union that its newest and weakest members are not up to the task of rooting out corruption that is a legacy of decades of Communist rule and, indeed, of weak governance before that. Across Eastern and Central Europe and the Balkans, countries are experiencing a surge of instability that, analysts say, stems almost in equal parts from endemic corruption and the sometimes ham-fisted efforts to combat it in the context of bitter political rivalries. The European Union, with 27 member nations, is so concerned about creeping lawlessness among its new members that Romania and its neighbor Bulgaria, which both entered in 2007, have not joined the bloc\u2019s passport\/visa-free travel area. On Thursday, the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, said concerns about corruption and fraud in Romania had prompted it to block E.U. development aid, potentially worth billions of euros. In Croatia, which is set to join the European Union next year, former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader has been charged with embezzlement. Romania, in particular, has struggled to overcome the aftermath of the ruthless, corrupt dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu. Over the past six years, 4,700 people have gone to trial on corruption charges, including 15 ministers and secretaries of state, 23 members of Parliament and more than 500 police officers. To many, Mr. Nastase, a former member of the Communist elite who was prime minister from 2000 to 2004, is emblematic of a generation of still active politicians who assumed that power and influence could shelter them from the law. Once asked to account for his apparent wealth, he defiantly roared, \u201cCount my eggs!\u201d a Romanian slang word for genitals. Monica Macovei, a former justice minister who is close to Mr. Nastase\u2019s archrival President Traian Basescu, said that \u201cThere are too many people from the Communist era like Nastase who are still in power, and this has polluted the political class.\u201d She said the former Communist bloc was struggling to root out corruption, in part because in the push to join the European Union, the new member states of the east had rushed through judicial reforms it had taken Western Europe centuries to put in place. Mr. Nastase\u2019s suicide attempt, she said, was pure \u201ctheater.\u201d While few but Mr. Nastase\u2019s closest allies \u2014 including the current prime minister, Victor Ponta \u2014 have sympathy for a man known as \u201cSeven-Houses Nastase\u201d by the Romanian news media because of his opulent lifestyle, some have questioned the zeal of his prosecution. Mr. Nastase\u2019s lawyers gave a litany of judicial abuses in his case, chief among them that the prosecution called 972 witnesses \u2014 more than in the Nuremberg trials \u2014 while the defense was permitted to call only 5. They said prosecutors had brazenly charged Mr. Nastase as leader of a party rather than as a former prime minister to avoid the required parliamentary approval of the charges. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/25\/business\/senate-panel-says-medtronic-edited-studies.html","body":"Officials of Medtronic, the medical device maker, edited studies by outside researchers about a controversial spine treatment sold by the company, inserting claims that their product was superior to a competing one, according to a Senate finance committee report released Thursday. \u00a0\u00a0The treatment at issue, known as Infuse, uses a bioengineered protein to fuse spinal vertebrae as a way of reducing back pain.

The Senate finance inquiry, which reviewed internal Medtronic documents, found that the company paid about $210 million from 1996 to 2010 in consulting fees, royalties and other payments to doctors involved in outside research on Infuse. In a statement, Medtronic said it vigorously disputed any suggestion that its employees had improperly influenced or written any of the medical journal reports. The company also said those studies had accurately represented the procedure\u2019s risks and that the payments to researchers had been largely royalty fees that were in line with industry practice. \u201cMedtronic does not agree with many of the findings\u201d in the report, the company stated. The Senate inquiry was spurred in part by the release last year of a special issue of a medical publication, The Spine Journal. In that report, a group of spine specialists publicly repudiated the studies performed by the Medtronic-financed researchers, saying they had understated serious adverse effects connected with Infuse, including male sterility. The researchers involved defended their reports as accurate. The Senate inquiry also found that internal Medtronic documents indicated that the company had put language into reports claiming that Infuse was superior to a bone graft because it eliminated the pain associated with harvesting bone from a patient\u2019s pelvis. Medtronic said that there was a medical debate about the complications of bone graft use and that any suggestions that it used that issue for marketing purposes was wrong. \u201cPatients everywhere will be better served by a more open, honest system without this kind of collusion,\u201d the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said in a statement. Last year, after publication of The Spine Journal issue, Medtronic took the unusual step of giving a $2.5 million grant to Yale so that independent researchers could conduct a broad review of all Infuse studies to determine the facts. That review is still under way. \u00a0Infuse, which was approved in 2002, is used in about a quarter of the estimated 432,000 spinal fusions performed in this country each year. The vast majority of those procedures involve so-called off-label uses by doctors in spinal procedures not approved by the Food and Drug Administration."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/25\/business\/global\/peugeot-wins-promise-of-state-aid-and-announces-pact-with-gm.html","body":"PARIS \u2014 PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn received a promise of state support for its finance unit on Wednesday, and said that it had agreed with General Motors to cooperate on four vehicle projects, as the French automaker seeks to get its struggling business back on track.Peugeot will obtain \u20ac7 billion, or $9 billion, in state credit guarantees, Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici and Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg said in a joint statement, assuming Parliament backs the plan. That will allow the company to issue new bonds to bolster the capital of its consumer finance unit, Banque PSA Finance, which has seen funding costs rise after a credit downgrade this month. The government of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, which views the auto industry as a strategic asset, has been alarmed by the decline in Peugeot\u2019s business and is buying time for the company to restructure. Peugeot\u2019s heavy reliance on Europe and its low-margin line-up have left it in worse shape than the up-market German automakers and its smaller French rival, Renault. In exchange for government help, the company is expected to reduce layoffs. Peugeot said in July that it planned to close a plant in Aulnay-sous-Bois, near Paris, and to lay off 8,000 workers in France. But neither the government nor the company made any concrete reference Wednesday to the future of Peugeot\u2019s workers, and Laure de Servigny, a Peugeot spokeswoman, said there were no labor conditions attached to the agreement. She said a restructuring report would be submitted to the board in November, and the issue of employment would be discussed. The ministers\u2019 statement said the government was \u201cparticularly attentive\u201d to the future of the company\u2019s employees, and called on the company to find \u201can employment solution\u201d for every employee. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told France Inter radio on Wednesday that the government \u201chas absolutely no intention of giving gifts, just like that, without anything in return. That time is over.\u201d The state and Peugeot\u2019s unions will each appoint a representative to the company\u2019s board, and Peugeot agreed not to pay dividends or issue stock options while it is receiving aid. Peugeot, the second-largest European automaker after Volkswagen, on Wednesday also reported an 8.5 percent decline in third-quarter automotive sales from a year earlier, to \u20ac12.9 billion. Shares of P.S.A. Peugeot Citro\u00ebn fell more than 4 percent in Paris afternoon trading. Like Peugeot, General Motors is trying turn around its European businesses, which include Opel and Vauxhall. Peugeot on Wednesday forecast that the European market, where it gets more than half its sales, would contract by 9 percent this year. \u201cThe competitive environment is getting tougher, with increased pricing pressure and ongoing deterioration in the markets of Southern Europe,\u201d Peugeot warned. Underscoring that grim picture, Ford Motor told workers on Wednesday that it would close an assembly plant in Genk, Belgium, and move production to Valencia, Spain. About 4,300 jobs will be lost as part of the restructuring, Ford said, adding that it plans to make further announcements on Thursday. Peugeot and G.M., which announced a tie-up in February under which G.M. acquired a 7 percent Peugeot stake, said they would jointly undertake four projects, including small- and mid-sized cars and vans made by Peugeot and G.M.\u2019s Opel and Vauxhall units. The projects will start to be ready in 2016, the two companies said. \u201cAll four projects will be developed combining the best platform architectures and technologies from the alliance partners,\u201d they said in a joint statement. G.M. and Peugeot also said they would source some parts together, \u201cto realize purchasing synergies benefitting both companies.\u201d The announcement could help to dispel doubts among impatient investors about the cooperation agreement, under which G.M. obtained 7 percent stake in Peugeot, but which so far has borne little fruit. The French daily Lib\u00e9ration reported Wednesday, without divulging its source, that Robert Peugeot, a leader of the family that holds 24 percent of the company\u2019s shares and controls 34 percent of the voting rights, was seeking to sell the family\u2019s stake to G.M. Ms. de Servigny said she had \u201cno information\u201d about any such plan. Pierre Zajdela, a spokesman for Robert Peugeot, said the family was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d interested in selling its stake in the group. \u201cThe Peugeot family is the reference shareholder for the company and it will remain so,\u201d he said. The General Motors-Peugeot announcement was greeted with skepticism by G.M.\u2019s European Employees Forum, which released a statement saying it \u201cwill not accept that employees will be played off against each other, neither inside the two companies nor between them. A race to the bottom concerning incomes and working conditions will not help any side of the alliance.\u201d Banque PSA Finance, the unit that is to get state aid, is particularly vulnerable to market pressure, as it does not currently take deposits. But Peugeot plans to introduce passbook savings accounts for its customers early next year and increasing the securitization of auto loans that are eligible for European Central Bank collateral, steps it says will shelter the unit from market stress. The plan must first be approved by the French Parliament and also by the European Commission, where it could raise antitrust concerns. In Brussels, the European competition commissioner, Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, said the French government had not notified him of its plans regarding Peugeot. Once such notification is made, he added, officials would give it a \u201cvery careful assessment.\u201d While the finance unit now appears to be on safe ground, the price of state involvement could prove to be a dangerously high one, Ian Fletcher, an analyst in London with IHS, wrote in a research note. With the state scrutinizing the company\u2019s actions, Peugeot's chief executive, Philippe Varin, now faces pressure to revisit his restructuring plans, Mr. Fletcher noted, raising the risk that it will do less than is essential to safeguard its future.

The deal still requires passage by the Greek Parliament, where it is certain to test the viability of the country\u2019s shaky governing coalition. The finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, also said Wednesday that Greece\u2019s European partners had agreed to give Athens additional time to carry out the austerity program \u2014 about 13.5 billion euros ($17.5 billion) of spending cuts and tax increases \u2014 instead of adopting it all immediately. The point would be to soften the blow to Greece\u2019s moribund economy, which is heading for its sixth consecutive year of recession. But Simon O\u2019Connor, spokesman for the European economic affairs commissioner, Olli Rehn, rebuffed reports that an extended timetable had yet been agreed to. The austerity package, months in the making, has fueled sometimes violent street protests by Greeks who are facing their third round of belt-tightening in three years. And getting the three-party coalition of the prime minister, Antonis Samaras, to approve the package remains an uphill battle. Mr. Samaras has warned members of his own New Democracy Party to approve the package or face being ousted. But some members of the coalition\u2019s junior partners \u2014 the Democratic Left and the socialist Pasok parties \u2014 are refusing to support wage and pension cuts, although they have pledged not to jeopardize Greece\u2019s access to more financial aid. Passage would require 151 of the Parliament\u2019s total 300 votes. The leader of the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party, which has ridden a tide of anger against immigrants and Greece\u2019s worsening economy, recently threatened to have the party\u2019s 18 parliamentary members resign when a vote is held, a move that, if carried out, could delay its passage. The measures need to be approved by Greek lawmakers before Nov. 12. That is when finance ministers from euro zone countries, scheduled to meet in Brussels, are expected to consider whether Greece should get its new tranche of aid. Should the measures pass, Greece\u2019s so-called troika of lenders \u2014 the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission \u2014 would issue a report gauging whether Greece has made sufficient progress in mending its tattered finances to receive the 31.5 billion euros in aid that Mr. Stournaras has said is needed for Greece to avoid bankruptcy. With state coffers virtually empty, an economy near depression and unemployment at a record high of 25 percent, Greece is counting on the money to keep the government running. It also needs to pay off a portion of more than 8 billion euros in arrears that it owes suppliers for basic products, like medicines, that some companies have stopped supplying to Greece until they are paid. And yet most of the money would not be put directly back into the economy. Instead, about 85 percent of the loan installment would go to replenishing the capital reserves of Greece\u2019s shaky banking system. Those cushions were depleted early this year after the banks lost huge amounts of money, when the government forced its creditors to take a 50 percent loss on the Greek bonds \u2014 held in large part by Greece\u2019s banks. Mr. Samaras, the prime minister, has said the money will enable banks to start lending again, fueling growth at a time when the government estimates that the economy will contract by 6.5 percent this year. But many Greeks are concerned that the banks would simply hold onto the money rather than lend to businesses, continuing a trend that has already led tens of thousands of small and medium-size enterprises to fold in the last several years. \u201cI\u2019m not confident that there will be a large portion of funds going into the market,\u201d said Constantine Mihalos, president of the Athens Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThe vast majority of the funds will be filling gaps\u201d in the banks\u2019 accounts, he added, so \u201cthe liquidity crunch that has resulted in the death of even healthy companies will go on.\u201d A draft version of the deal, leaked to the media late Tuesday, included cutbacks in the public sector, where 5,000 civil servants would be placed on reduced wages this year before being either transferred to other jobs or dismissed. The same would happen to another 20,000 in 2013. The retirement age would increase by two years, to 67 from 65, while certain categories of civil servants on \u201cspecial salaries\u201d would see their wages cut by as much as 35 percent. The draft package also foresees a reduction in the number of associate professors at state universities from 15,226 to 2,000 and an end to the majority of tax exemptions. An emergency \u201csolidarity\u201d tax on income would be extended until 2018. Mr. Stournaras, the finance minister, told Parliament on Wednesday that Greece aimed to reduce its debt burden by lowering the interest rate on the rescue loans it receives from the troika and extending the payback periods of those loans. Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: October 24, 2012An earlier version of this article misstated the plan for changing the retirement age.

Many other members apparently welcomed Mr. Draghi\u2019s visit and the chance to pose questions directly to him, although some opposition lawmakers maintained criticism that the E.C.B. plan amounted to a first step on a path toward common sharing of debt among the 17 states using the euro. Mr. Draghi met with about 150 lawmakers, mostly members of the finance, budgetary and European affairs committees, rather than the full assembly. It would have been considered inappropriate for him to address the full Bundestag, an honor reserved for heads of state or dignitaries like the pope. In his opening remarks, Mr. Draghi addressed the criticisms point by point, telling lawmakers that the bond-buying program would not lead to disguised financing of governments, compromise the bank\u2019s independence, nor create excessive risks for taxpayers nor lead to inflation. Mr. Draghi already had the backing of Chancellor Angela Merkel and her finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, but many lawmakers who had remained unsure about the program expressed approval of the thoroughness and detail that Mr. Draghi drew from to explain the bank\u2019s decisions. \u201cHis answers were very convincing, and we can therefore give the message to German citizens that fears of inflation that have been expressed here and there are unfounded,\u201d said Norbert Barthle, a senior member of the chancellor\u2019s party. Even though the plan, known as Outright Monetary Transactions, or O.M.T., has not yet been implemented, its existence has already contributed to an easing of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone by pushing down the borrowing costs of fragile countries like Spain. The lawmakers had sought reassurances about the conditions under which it would be run, and Mr. Draghi explained that by linking it to receiving nations implementing reforms, its goal remained in step with overall efforts to restructure the economies of weaker euro zone members. Emerging from the closed-door session, Mr. Draghi said he had welcomed the tough questioning. \u201cThese opportunities make you think, but also express your views in a way that can be understood by nonspecialists,\u201d he said, \u201cby people who don\u2019t do this 24 hours a day, every day of their lives.\u201d An appearance by the E.C.B. president before members of the Bundestag is not unique. Mr. Draghi\u2019s predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, briefed German lawmakers in April 2010 on the details of the first financial bailout for Greece, along with Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then head of the International Monetary Fund. But such meetings are rare, and Wednesday\u2019s reflected how important Mr. Draghi, a former head of the Bank of Italy, views keeping German lawmakers on his side. Among the fiercest critics of his plan has been Jens Weidmann, the president of Germany\u2019s central bank. He was the only one of 23 members of the E.C.B.\u2019s Governing Council to oppose the plan, arguing that it would violate a ban on using the central bank to finance governments. Michael Meister, a member of the chancellor\u2019s conservative Christian Democratic party, echoed those concerns in telling Rheinische Post on Wednesday that he expected Mr. Draghi to voice \u201cclear support for monetary stability and clear rejection of E.C.B. intervention in financing governments.\u201d Mr. Draghi has defended the bond-buying program by saying that taking no action would have posed a greater danger. He has insisted that the plan is fully within the bank\u2019s mandate to ensure price stability in the euro zone. Since announcement of the plan on Sept. 6, talk of the euro zone\u2019s breaking apart has quieted and investors have brought down interest rates on loans to Spain and Italy. Experts acknowledge the benefits brought about by the program, but warn that without the necessary structural changes to the economies of the weaker euro zone members, there can be no lasting recovery and that inflation remains a threat. German worries about the economy are not unfounded. Germany\u2019s business community\u2019s confidence fell in October for the sixth straight month, a survey by the Ifo institute in Munich showed Wednesday. The survey of 7,000 executives dropped to 100.0 from 101.4, despite forecasts that it would rise, reflecting that uncertainties stemming from the sovereign debt crisis, now in its third year."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/25\/opinion\/student-debt-debacles.html","body":"Students who finance their educations through private lenders often wrongly assume that private and federal loans work the same way. In fact, they do not.Most federal student loans have rates of 6.8 percent (or less) and offer broad consumer protections that allow people who lose their jobs to make lower, affordable payments or to defer payment until they recover financially. Private student loans \u2014 from banks and other private institutions \u2014 typically come with variable interest rates and fewer consumer protections, which means that borrowers who get into trouble have few options other than default. Many borrowers did not learn about the differences between private and federal loans until after they became deeply indebted. And because of confusion about variable rates, they are sometimes shocked to learn what they owe when that first bill arrives. The problem is serious because private student loans now account for $150 billion of the $1 trillion in total outstanding student loan debt in the country, according to the first annual report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s student loan ombudsman. The report found that many loan servicers \u2014 the companies that collect the payments for the lenders \u2014 make it extremely difficult for student borrowers to manage their debts. Borrowers often have difficulty finding out how much they owe or getting information about their payment histories. Some struggling borrowers who need loan modification said that servicers forced them to pay more per month than they could possibly afford, without telling them the payments would not prevent default. In some cases, those who made late or partial payments were subjected to unauthorized checking account deductions that then led to overdrafts and costly fees. One borrower learned that his loan was put into default when a parent who had co-signed for the loan filed for bankruptcy protection. He reported that he could get no information about how to cure the problem. Slipshod loan servicing makes private student loans even riskier by increasing the likelihood that people will fall behind in payments. The bureaucratic errors and obstacles mean that conscientious borrowers who took out high-priced loans are not only saddled with crushing debt, they may also have their credit ruined \u2014 making it extremely hard to refinance their loans or get future loans to buy a home or start a business. The federal government needs to open up refinancing and debt relief opportunities for these people, as it did for some mortgage holders. The bureau should also set national standards for loan servicers to require clear disclosure of conditions, advance notice of any changes in the status of the account and prompt resolution of customer requests for information. And borrowers who might be eligible for federal loans should be advised to examine that option before plunging headlong into private debt."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/25\/world\/europe\/a-masters-degree-by-way-of-the-trading-floor.html","body":"LONDON \u2014 David Dukes had a problem. For many years he worked as a futures trader, buying and selling complicated financial instruments tied to movements in the price of stocks and commodities in the United States and government bonds across Europe. Like Sherman McCoy, the bond trader at the heart of Tom Wolfe\u2019s novel \u201cThe Bonfire of the Vanities,\u201d successful traders can earn enough money to live like \u201cMasters of the Universe.\u201dAs the headlines about Kweku Adoboli , the former UBS trader accused of causing losses of $2.3 billion, show, however, the fall from grace can be dramatic. After several years as a trader, Mr. Dukes was put in charge of his employer\u2019s training and recruitment efforts. The company, Futex, had long offered ambitious university graduates an intensive 12-week training course with the promise that the best-performing recruits would be able to continue trading with the company\u2019s backing \u2014 and its money. Futex also had an apprenticeship program for people who wished to skip university and get onto the trading floor more quickly, after a year of training. Both training routes are popular. \u201cWe get somewhere in the region of 200 applicants a week,\u201d Mr. Dukes said. The problem, he said, is that while the company can test applicants for mathematical ability and knowledge about the markets, \u201cit\u2019s very difficult to say how people will perform once they start trading with real money.\u201d Futex is a proprietary trading business, meaning that employees trade on the company\u2019s account rather than on behalf of clients. They keep a share of their profits that starts at 50 percent and can rise to 90 percent for those who are most successful. \u201cOn an exceptional day, you can make six figures,\u201d Mr. Dukes said. But a run of bad trades can wipe out the company\u2019s profit. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that in order to maintain an edge over the market in today\u2019s world, an increase in academic knowledge is required,\u201d he said. Mr. Dukes took his problem to the University of Hertfordshire , which responded by offering to develop a Master of Science degree in proprietary trading. It is a one-year course for those who choose to study full time, but \u201cstudents can also dip in and out,\u201d Quintin McKellar, vice chancellor of the university, said in an interview. The first group of 20 students began classes on Oct. 1; a second intake will start in January. Tuition for the course is \u00a316,000, or about $25,600. \u201cThere\u2019s no difference in fees from any of our other master\u2019s degree courses,\u201d Dr. McKellar said. However, instead of traveling to the university\u2019s campus in Hatfield, which is just north of London, students will \u201cspend a lot of time on the trading floor, with actual traders,\u201d he said. Dr. McKellar, who was formerly the dean of the Royal Veterinary College in London, said that the University of Hertfordshire was increasingly seeking opportunities to offer what he called \u201ccorporate degrees,\u201d partly as a response to cuts in government financing. \u201cWe have a subsidiary company called Exemplas that began as a way of helping small- and medium-sized businesses,\u201d Dr. McKellar said. \u201cThat work used to be funded by government, but funding for that sort of thing has dried up.\u201d \u201cThe whole ethos behind a corporate degree is that, instead of forcing the business to choose from courses we already offer, it lets the business act as the senior partner,\u201d he added. Mr. Dukes, the trader, agreed. \u201cWe were able to cherry-pick the elements we wanted,\u201d he said. The first 14 weeks of the course are spent primarily on the company\u2019s electronic trading floor, either at its headquarters in Woking, southwest of London, or at its office in London\u2019s financial district. The next 14-week module is devoted to classes on markets, financial institutions and policy, followed by another 14 weeks learning about the global economy. \u201cWe want traders who can understand the impact of macroeconomic events on share prices,\u201d Mr. Dukes said. \u201cThey need to understand the impact of the sovereign debt crisis on bond prices in different currencies, and the possible influence of decisions made by the European Central Bank, governments or the European Commission.\u201d Students spend the final seven weeks of the course working on a thesis based on data they have gathered during the course. \u201cFutex has made a commitment to hire some of the graduates,\u201d Dr. McKellar said. He added that students in the university\u2019s corporate degree programs \u201chave a slightly better record of graduating with first-class honors\u201d \u2014 the highest academic achievement \u2014 than other students. As to the risk that Hertfordshire trading graduates might end up in the wrong kind of headlines, Jonathan Easter, chair of the university\u2019s finance and economics department, said: \u201cThe program is designed to help graduates develop the ability to build sustainable, successful positions.\u201d \u201cThis is vital for them, not least because ultimately they will be trading on their own account, not with client money,\u201d Mr. Easter said. \u201cThe program will therefore ensure that graduates are aware of all relevant regulatory controls, and Futex will closely monitor behavior and trades of all graduates who go on to work for them.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/25\/world\/middleeast\/gaza-militants-fire-rockets-and-mortars-into-southern-israel.html","body":"JERUSALEM \u2014 A surge in violence on Wednesday across the Israel-Gaza border prompted strong warnings from Israeli leaders that if pushed, Israel would act more forcefully against militants in Gaza, the Palestinian coastal enclave.Palestinian militants fired more than 60 rockets from Gaza into southern Israel overnight and early Wednesday, hitting several houses and wounding three Thai workers, two critically, in an Israeli border community, according to the Israeli military. Israel carried out several airstrikes against rocket-launching squads, killing four militants, Palestinian officials said. Three of the four belonged to Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza. The rocket fire began hours after a landmark visit to Gaza by the emir of Qatar, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the first head of state to visit Gaza since Hamas took full control there in 2007. It also came as a major American-Israeli joint military exercise was under way in Israel, underlining the volatility in the area at a delicate time before the American elections, in less than two weeks, and Israeli elections, scheduled for January. The Israeli government has come under increasing criticism from residents of southern Israel who have been forced into protected spaces and bomb shelters during repeated bouts of cross-border violence. Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, and his defense minister, Ehud Barak, paid separate visits to the south on Wednesday. \u201cWe neither chose nor initiated this escalation,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said during a visit to a battery of Israel\u2019s Iron Dome antirocket missile system near the southern city of Ashkelon. \u201cBut if it continues, we are prepared for much more extensive and deeper action.\u201d Mr. Barak said, \u201cHamas will receive its punishment for what has happened here.\u201d He added, \u201cWe do not intend to allow the continued violation of normal life in the south of Israel.\u201d But Israeli analysts said that neither side seemed to want a major conflict. Mr. Barak also said that Israel would \u201ccontinue to work with patience and levelheadedness.\u201d In recent years Hamas, which does not recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist, has largely adhered to an informal cease-fire, raising questions on both sides about the timing of the latest escalation. Both Israel and Hamas refrained from any actions during the hours of the emir\u2019s visit, but on Tuesday morning, hours before his arrival in Gaza, an Israeli officer was severely wounded in a blast from an explosive device placed by militants along the border. A leftist Palestinian group claimed responsibility for that attack on Tuesday. Later the military wing of Hamas also took credit. The military wing of Hamas then claimed responsibility for firing rockets into Israel \u201cas a response to the ongoing aggression against the Palestinian people.\u201d Hamas has been under local pressure from more radical groups in recent months and may be eager to show that it has not abandoned what it calls the resistance against Israel. There was also some speculation in Israel that Hamas might also have wanted to retaliate for the destruction of a weapons factory in Sudan early Wednesday. Sudan blamed Israel for bombing the factory from the air, presumably to prevent its weapons from reaching Gaza. Neither Israel nor Hamas has commented officially on the Sudanese accusations. Mkhaimar Abusada, a professor of political science at al-Azhar University in Gaza, said that Israel wanted to preserve its deterrence as the Palestinian factions appeared to be building up their arsenals, including with weapons smuggled from Libya. Israel carried out a three-week military offensive in Gaza in the winter of 2008-9, with the stated purpose of curbing persistent rocket fire from Gaza into southern Israel. Israeli officials say that more than 600 rockets have struck southern Israel this year. But the introduction of the Iron Dome system, developed with financing from the United States, has allowed Israel more room for maneuver, intercepting longer-range rockets from Gaza that were headed toward Israeli cities, avoiding mass casualties and the subsequent imperative for a stronger Israeli response. The military said that on Wednesday Iron Dome intercepted seven rockets. The success of the Iron Dome system is also important to President Obama as he seeks to emphasize his administration\u2019s military and security commitment to Israel. In Monday\u2019s foreign policy debate between Mr. Obama and Mitt Romney, Mr. Obama told how he had visited the Israeli town of Sderot, near the Gaza border, during his last campaign. Noting that the town \u201chad experienced missiles raining down from Hamas,\u201d he said his administration had financed the Iron Dome program \u201cto stop those missiles.\u201d Israel announced on Wednesday that it would finance antirocket fortifications of 1,700 Israeli homes near the Gaza border. But residents of southern Israel said their patience was wearing thin. \u201cIt is absurd that we live like this,\u201d said Yael Sadin, 49, a resident of a kibbutz, or communal farm, which was struck by five rockets on Wednesday morning.

He has drafted legislation that he said would force more responsibility for the tone and messages of the campaign onto the candidates and the political parties and away from the third-party groups. The staff of Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, is also working on proposals. The 2010 Supreme Court ruling, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, was expected to be an unalloyed advantage to Republicans, who have a deeper bench of rich individuals and corporations willing to finance candidates. The decision has appeared to benefit Republicans over all this election cycle, as Republican money has poured into the presidential contest. Democrats say their third-party allies have also been outspent, by about two to one, in Senate campaigns. But the impact of Citizens United has come with complications, with some Republican incumbents in the House at a disadvantage. Earlier this month, before Republicans surged ahead with an additional $25 million, the total spending and reservations for ad time in the House campaigns has been dead even at $89 million, according to the National Republican Congressional Committee. Conservative donors were confident that the House Republican majority was secure and sent their money elsewhere. Democratic donors, including unions and environmental groups like the League of Conservation Voters, have been more strategic, concentrating their fire on a handful of vulnerable House Republicans. Mr. Lungren said the attacks on him began just months after the 2010 election, with radio advertisements and automated phone calls. They have accelerated into an onslaught of television commercials in what has become the most expensive House race in the country. Mr. Lungren\u2019s Democratic opponent is Ami Bera, a doctor. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is transform the system so people participating as candidates can be held responsible for what is said,\u201d Mr. Lungren said of the legislation he is drafting. He said the 2012 experience could be transformative for other Republicans who have spent the last six months enduring the grim piano music and disconsolate faces of \u201cvoters\u201d in negative ad after ad, sometimes against them and sometimes on their behalf but always without their signoff. \u201cWe had to see how this worked out for a cycle,\u201d he said. Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who runs the group charged with electing Republicans to the Senate, has said he thinks it would be worthwhile to examine the campaign finance system after the election. \u201cRevisiting the federal fund-raising restrictions and coordinated limits on both parties, and even smaller, common-sense steps like requiring electronic filing for federal candidates are a few good things that could be looked at next year,\u201d he said in an e-mail. Ms. Murkowski has spoken on the Senate floor in a similar vein. The proposals her staff is drafting have a similar thrust. The odds of legislation passing remain unclear. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, has vehemently opposed efforts to require the unveiling of secret donors. \u201cThe courts have said that Congress doesn\u2019t have the authority to muzzle political speech,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in June to the American Enterprise Institute during a speech on campaign finance restrictions. Since the Supreme Court ruling, Democrats in Congress have tried to legislate curbs on campaign advertising. Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York drafted the Disclose Act, Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections, which narrowly passed the House in 2010 and received majority support in the Senate but fell one vote short of the 60 votes needed to break a Republican filibuster. In the last two years, however, support has waned considerably. When Senate Democrats tried again in May, the measure got just 51 votes. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/24\/business\/global\/france-to-back-peugeot-with-7-billion-euros-in-credit-guarantees.html","body":"PARIS \u2014 The French government is preparing to announce that it will provide PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn with credit guarantees worth as much as \u20ac7 billion in exchange for sparing some of the 8,000 jobs it was planning to cut, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said Tuesday.President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s government will also seek changes in the company\u2019s governance, including the addition of a government representative to the board, according to the person, who asked not to be identified because the matter is not yet official and some details remain to be arranged. Peugeot\u2019s cost for the funds it uses to help consumers finance car purchases has risen since Moody\u2019s cut its credit rating on Oct. 12. Fitch Ratings downgraded the company in September. That makes it harder to compete with carmakers that can offer better terms. A government guarantee of future bond offerings by the finance unit should give investors greater security that they will be repaid and hold down the interest rate the company must pay to borrow. Peugeot\u2019s rivals on the Continent may nonetheless challenge state aid at the European Commission, arguing that the guarantees would give the company an unfair advantage. Peugeot has presented Mr. Hollande, a Socialist in his first year in office, with a serious test. The company has been burning through its cash and plans to shutter a major production facility at Aulnay-sous-Bois, near Paris. Peugeot ranks second among European automakers, after Volkswagen, but has suffered badly since the onset of the global financial crisis. At the root of the automaker\u2019s problems is its heavy dependence on relatively low-margin models in the moribund European car market. European car sales fell 10.8 percent in September from a year earlier, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association. The company \u201cfaces significant challenges in its efforts to turn around its loss-making automotive business and to reduce the currently high cash burn within its operations by implementing announced initiatives to reduce fixed costs and adjust capacities,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in its downgrade report this month. Moody\u2019s said the outlook for the company\u2019s credit rating was negative. Pierre-Olivier Salmon, a spokesman for the French company, declined to comment. The company\u2019s stock, which was down slightly in late afternoon trading in Paris on Tuesday, has fallen more than 60 percent over the last year. Arnaud Montebourg, the French industry minister, has been meeting with Peugeot officials to arrange a rescue for the finance unit, Banque PSA Finance. An announcement on the funding guarantee could be made as early as Tuesday night, the person said. Peugeot\u2019s weakness drove it in February to announce that General Motors would acquire a 7 percent stake. That deal made G.M. second only to the Peugeot family among the car company\u2019s shareholders. The French company also said in September that it was negotiating to sell 75 percent of its Gefco logistics business to J.S.C. Russian Railways, a deal that would bring Peugeot more than $1 billion and help it to rebuild its cash buffer. Both Peugeot and its smaller rival, Renault, received bailouts of about \u20ac1 billion in February 2009."}]
