### Environment Setting Up

We are using Stanford Parser Lib from [Stanford NLP] (http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/index.shtml) for labelling and feature extraction.
In order to develop,

1. Import the project through following steps:
   File->Import->General->Existing Projects into Workspace->Next->Select root directory->Browse and then select the java project where you save. Basically, just locate the NLP folder ( we have the java project) in your local git repo.
2. Download the software [here] (http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml#Download) if you have not done yet and add in four external jars in to java build path of your current project.
