That triumvirate played a leading role in helping end the eight-day conflict between Israel and Gaza, in large part by embracing Hamas and luring it further away from the Iran-Syria-Hezbollah fold, offering diplomatic clout and promises of hefty aid. For the United States and Israel, the shifting dynamics offer a chance to isolate a resurgent Iran, limit its access to the Arab world and make it harder for Tehran to arm its agents on Israel\u2019s border. But the gains are also tempered, because while these Sunni leaders are willing to work with Washington, unlike the mullahs in Tehran, they also promote a radical religious-based ideology that has fueled anti-Western sentiment around the region. Hamas \u2014 which received missiles from Iran that reached Israel\u2019s northern cities \u2014 broke with the Iranian axis last winter, openly backing the rebellion against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. But its affinity with the Egypt-Qatar-Turkey axis came to fruition this fall. \u201cThat camp has more assets that it can share than Iran \u2014 politically, diplomatically, materially,\u201d said Robert Malley, the Middle East program director for the International Crisis Group. \u201cThe Muslim Brotherhood is their world much more so than Iran.\u201d The Gaza conflict helps illustrate how Middle Eastern alliances have evolved since the Islamist wave that toppled one government after another beginning in January 2011. Iran had no interest in a cease-fire, while Egypt, Qatar and Turkey did. But it is the fight for Syria that is the defining struggle in this revived Sunni-Shiite duel. The winner gains a prized strategic crossroads. For now, it appears that that tide is shifting against Iran, there too, and that it might well lose its main Arab partner, Syria. The Sunni-led opposition appears in recent days to have made significant inroads against the government, threatening the Assad family\u2019s dynastic rule of 40 years and its long alliance with Iran. If Mr. Assad falls, that would render Iran and Hezbollah, which is based in Lebanon, isolated as a Shiite Muslim alliance in an ever more sectarian Middle East, no longer enjoying a special street credibility as what Damascus always tried to sell as \u201cthe beating heart of Arab resistance.\u201d If the shifts seem to leave the United States somewhat dazed, it is because what will emerge from all the ferment remains obscure. Clearly the old leaders Washington relied on to enforce its will, like President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, are gone or at least eclipsed. But otherwise confusion reigns in terms of knowing how to deal with this new paradigm, one that could well create societies infused with religious ideology that Americans find difficult to accept. The new reality could be a weaker Iran, but a far more religiously conservative Middle East that is less beholden to the United States. Already, Islamists have been empowered in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, while Syria\u2019s opposition is being led by Sunni insurgents, including a growing number identified as jihadists, some identified as sympathizing with Al Qaeda. Qatar, which hosts a major United States military base, also helps finance Islamists all around the region. In Egypt, President Mohamed Morsi resigned as a member of the Muslim Brotherhood only when he became head of state, but he still remains closely linked with the movement. Turkey, the model for many of them, has kept strong relations with Washington while diminishing the authority of generals who were longstanding American allies. \u201cThe United States is part of a landscape that has shifted so dramatically,\u201d said Mr. Malley of the International Crisis Group. \u201cIt is caught between the displacement of the old moderate-radical divide by one that is defined by confessional and sectarian loyalty.\u201d The emerging Sunni axis has put not only Shiites at a disadvantage, but also the old school leaders who once allied themselves with Washington. The old guard members in the Palestinian Authority are struggling to remain relevant at a time when their failed 20-year quest to end the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands makes them seem both anachronistic and obsolete. \u201cHamas has always argued that it is the future of the changes in the region because of its revolutionary nature, that it is part of the religious political groups who have been winning the revolutions,\u201d said Ghassan Khatib, an official at Birzeit University and former government spokesman. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/28\/us\/politics\/senior-congressman-urges-gop-to-accept-extension-of-bush-tax-cuts.html","body":"WASHINGTON \u2014 A senior House Republican on Tuesday urged his party\u2019s leadership to embrace the immediate extension of the Bush-era tax cuts for households earning less than $250,000, then fight out the fate of higher-income tax breaks later.In a private meeting of the House Republican whip team, the group responsible for vote counting, Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma broke with the rest of the leadership and said the party should join with President Obama for now, Republican aides said. The meeting was first reported by Politico. \"The first thing I\u2019d do is make sure we don\u2019t raise taxes on 98 percent of the American people,\" he said in an interview Tuesday night. \"We\u2019ll get some credit for that, and it\u2019s the right thing to do.\" The break came after senior Democrats hardened their line on conditions for a deal to head off the automatic spending cuts and tax increases set to kick in this January. Democrats said Tuesday that Mr. Obama would not accept any deficit reduction deal that did not include a long-term extension of the debt ceiling, possibly ensuring that Mr. Obama would not have to deal with another debilitating fiscal showdown for the remainder of his presidency. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, and Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, both said they did not intend to complete a major deficit reduction deal only to have Republicans reopen it each time the government bumped up against its statutory borrowing limit. \u201cWe would be somewhat foolish to work on something on stopping us from going over the cliff, and a month or six weeks later, the Republicans pull the same thing they did before and say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to do anything unless this happens or we don\u2019t increase the debt ceiling,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cI agree with the president. It has to be a package deal.\u201d The stern posture may throw another roadblock in the way of a deal before January, when hundreds of billions of dollars in automatic spending cuts and tax increases kick in, possibly sending the economy back into recession. Conservative Republicans have said they want the debt ceiling left out of any deal to maintain leverage on Washington to keep trimming the deficit. But the position taken by Mr. Cole suggested Republicans could be softening. An extension of the middle-class tax cuts would significantly diminish, or erase, any leverage Republicans might have to preserve tax cuts for more affluent households and some small businesses. But the leadership\u2019s political position will grow even more tenuous if prominent Republicans like Mr. Cole say it is time for a quick deal that would preserve the tax breaks of 98 percent of households and 97 percent of small businesses. \"I don\u2019t believe in holding the American people hostage to this debate,\" Mr. Cole said. \"Let\u2019s get what we can now, then go back and try to get the rest. Where there is common ground with the president, we should seize that common ground.\" Democrats on Tuesday laid out a series of demands that either showed confidence in the flexibility of defeated Republicans or indicated a brewing stalemate. Senator Max Baucus of Montana, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, flatly rejected a Republican proposal to cap tax deductions and credits at $25,000 a household instead of allowing tax rates to rise. \u201cI just want to point out a $25,000 cap will mean about a quarter of those who will pay more taxes will not be wealthy Americans but middle-income Americans,\u201d Mr. Baucus said. \u201cWhen that\u2019s fully understood I think the interest in that is going to wane.\u201d Mr. Durbin said the president would also demand a guarantee that the spending caps in any deal be adhered to and not reopened. Last year, Congress and the president agreed to 10 years of domestic spending caps as part of the deal to raise the debt ceiling, only to see House Republicans try to impose lower spending levels six months later. Democrats said they would not accept cuts to Medicare or Medicaid as part of the upfront \u201cdown payment\u201d on deficit reduction that would be passed next month along with a broader framework on tax and entitlement changes to be worked over in 2013. In a speech at the liberal Center for American Progress, Mr. Durbin still expressed confidence that beneath all the public posturing, the White House and Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, were making progress toward averting the so-called fiscal cliff. Mr. Durbin\u2019s speech itself was a measure of conciliation, laying out the case to liberals for a major deficit deal. He made clear that the parties agreed on what a final deal would look like: an initial deficit-reduction down payment to calm financial markets and avoid most of the fiscal jolt that would otherwise hit in January; instructions to Congressional committees to draft tax, spending and entitlement legislation to save around $4 trillion over the next decade; and some form of fallback deficit plan in case Congress fails to pass those changes. Mr. Durbin said that Medicare should not be tapped for that upfront down payment but that federal health care programs should be part of next year\u2019s deliberations. And he opened the door for money-saving adjustments to Mr. Obama\u2019s signature health care law, so long as it was not gutted or repealed. The Democrats\u2019 firm position on the debt ceiling was expected by Republican leaders, who went through a near-crisis in 2011 when House conservatives refused to raise the borrowing limit, nearly sending the federal government into default. The government will reach its borrowing limit again early next year. Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, said that regardless of how that looming deadline was dealt with, the speaker would insist on his own rule: any increase in the debt ceiling must be accompanied by spending cuts of at least the same magnitude.

After a hard-won re-election fought mainly over taxes and spending, President Obama arguably has a mandate from voters to tap the wealthy to address our budget woes.What\u2019s more, raising more money from the wealthy might go a long way toward righting our lopsided economy \u2014 which delivered 93 percent of our income growth in the first two years of the economic recovery to the richest 1 percent of families, and only 7 percent to the rest of us. Yet while raising more taxes from the winners in the globalized economy is a start, and may help us dig out of our immediate fiscal hole, it is unlikely to be enough to address our long-term needs. The experience of many other developed countries suggests that paying for a government that could help the poor and the middle class cope in our brave new globalized world will require more money from the middle class itself. Many Americans may find this hard to believe, but the United States already has one of the most progressive tax systems in the developed world, according to several studies, raising proportionately more revenue from the wealthy than other advanced countries do. Taxes on American households do more to redistribute resources and reduce inequality than the tax codes of most other rich nations. But taxation provides only half the picture of public finance. Despite the progressivity of our taxes, according to a study of public finances across the industrial countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, we also have one of the least effective governments at combating income inequality. There is one main reason: our tax code does not raise enough money. This paradox underscores two crucial lessons we could learn from the experience of our peers around the globe. The first is that the government\u2019s success at combating income inequality is determined less by the progressivity of either the tax code or the benefits than by the amount of tax revenue that the government can spend on programs that benefit the middle class and the poor. The second is that very progressive tax codes are not very effective at raising money. The corollary \u2014 suggested by Peter Lindert of the University of California, Davis in his 2004 book \u201cGrowing Public\u201d \u2014 is that insisting on highly progressive taxes that draw most revenue from the rich may result in more inequality than if we relied on a flatter, more \u201cregressive\u201d tax schedule to raise money from everybody and pay for a government that could help every American family attain a decent standard of living. Consider government aid for families. According to the O.E.C.D. study, our Temporary Assistance for Needy Families is the most progressive program of cash benefits for families among 22 advanced countries, accurately targeted to serve the poor. But American family cash benefits are the least effective at reducing inequality. The reason is that they are so meager. The entire budget for cash assistance for families in the United States amounts to one-tenth of 1 percent of the nation\u2019s economic output. The average across the O.E.C.D. nations is 11 times bigger. Even including tax breaks and direct government services, we spend a much smaller share of our economic output on family assistance than almost any other advanced nation. The same pattern can be found across a range of government programs. The reason is always the same: their relatively small size. Over all, government cash benefits in the United States \u2014 including pensions, disability, unemployment insurance and the like \u2014 contribute about 10 percent to household income, on average, according to the study. The average across industrial nations is twice that. Our budget reveals a core philosophical difference with other advanced countries. In the big-government social democracies like those of Western Europe, government is expected to guarantee a set of universal public services \u2014 from health care to child care to pensions \u2014 that are considered basic rights of citizenry. To pay for this minimum welfare package, everybody is expected to contribute proportionately into the pot. Government in the United States has a different goal. Benefits are narrower. Social Security and Medicare follow a universal service template, but only for older Americans. Other social spending is aimed carefully to benefit the poor. Financed through a more progressive tax code, it looks more like charity than a universal right. On top of that, our philosophical stance virtually ensures a small government. Progressive taxes make it hard to raise money because they distort people\u2019s behavior. They encourage taxpayers to reduce their tax liability rather than to increase their pretax income. High corporate taxes encourage companies to avoid them. High taxes on capital income also encourage avoidance and capital flight. High income tax rates on top earners can discourage work and investment, too. So trying to raise a lot of money with our progressive tax code would probably not achieve the goal and could damage economic growth. Big-government social democracies, by contrast, rely on flatter taxes to finance their public spending, like gas taxes and value-added taxes on consumption. The Nordic countries, for instance, have very low tax rates on capital income relative to income from work. And they have relatively high taxes on consumption. In Denmark, consumption tax revenue amounts to about 11 percent of the nation\u2019s economy. In the United States, sales taxes and excise taxes on cigarettes and other items amount to roughly 4 percent. Liberal Democrats have long opposed them because they fall much more heavily on the poor, who spend a larger share of their incomes than the rich. But these taxes have one big positive feature: they are difficult to avoid and produce fewer disincentives to work or invest. That means they can be used to raise much more revenue. Public finances are under strain today on both sides of the Atlantic, as governments struggle to cope with our long global recession and the aging of the baby boom generation. In Southern Europe, the pressure to pare back universal welfare systems is intense. In the United States, political leaders on both sides of the partisan divide have realized that even our relatively meager package of social goods cannot be sustained with our slim tax take. But the United States has one option that most of Europe\u2019s flailing economies do not. Its tax revenue is so low, comparatively, that it has more space to raise it. A more efficient, flatter tax schedule would allow us to do so without hindering economic activity. Bruce Bartlett, a tax expert who served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, told me last week that he thought federal tax revenue could increase to 22 percent of the nation\u2019s economic output, well above its historical average of 18.5 percent, without causing economic harm. If President Obama tries to go down this road, however, he may have to build a flatter tax code. \u201cWe should reform the tax system, no question,\u201d William Gale, a tax policy expert at the Brookings Institution and co-director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, wrote in an e-mail. \u201cWe are going to need to move beyond the current set of tax instruments to raise the needed revenues \u2014 a VAT and or a carbon tax seem like the obvious ways to go.\u201d And Mr. Bartlett, who writes a column for The New York Times\u2019s Economix blog, also pointed out: \u201cWe can\u2019t get all the revenue we need from the rich. Eventually, everyone will have to pay more.\u201d E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/28\/nyregion\/jeffrey-d-kleins-group-favors-coalition-with-new-york-senate-republicans.html","body":"Jeffrey D. Klein has been taking calls from labor leaders and rank-and-file state senators. He ate pasta with the Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Republican from Long Island. And he sat down, he said, to \u201cclear the air\u201d with the minority leader, John L. Sampson, a Brooklyn Democrat.For three weeks, Senator Klein has been at once a sought-after and resented man in Albany. When the State Legislature reconvenes in January, he could hold the Senate\u2019s fate in his hands: he leads a breakaway faction of four fellow Democrats who are poised to negotiate a power-sharing agreement with the Senate Republicans. The exact makeup of the Senate will not be known until the last ballots are counted in two still-unresolved races. But regardless of the outcomes, only a seat or two will separate the two parties, and Mr. Klein is pushing for what he described as a \u201cbipartisan coalition,\u201d made up of his breakaway foursome and the Senate Republican caucus, to control the Senate. \u201cI think we can actually show that our democracy in New York State does not have to be chaotic,\u201d Mr. Klein said in an interview in his district office in the Bronx on Tuesday. \u201cIt could work, Democrats and Republicans working together to get things done.\u201d Democrats emerged from Election Day claiming to have won a majority in the Senate \u2014 which had been controlled by Republicans \u2014 but their chances at running the chamber have diminished. The Democratic candidate is leading in one of the two unresolved races. But the other Democratic candidate who held a narrow lead on Election Day, Cecilia F. Tkaczyk of Schenectady County, has been overtaken by the Republican during ballot counting that is not yet complete, leaving the outcome in doubt. One Democratic senator-elect, Simcha Felder of Brooklyn, has already said that he would support Republican control of the chamber. Mr. Klein has largely stayed out of the public eye since the Nov. 6 election left control of the Senate in dispute. But in the interview, he made clear that the independent Democrats were not interested in reuniting with their colleagues behind a Democratic Senate leader. Democrats had a majority in the Senate in 2009 and 2010, when Mr. Klein was deputy leader, but their control of the chamber was hampered by an embarrassing coup and infighting. \u201cWe can\u2019t go back to the days of dysfunction,\u201d Mr. Klein said. \u201cWe can\u2019t go back to the days of relying on every single Democrat to get things done, ignoring the other side completely, jamming through a legislative agenda which doesn\u2019t have bipartisan support.\u201d Mr. Klein formed his Independent Democratic Conference in January 2011 with three others: David Carlucci of Rockland County, who at 31 is the youngest member of the Senate; Diane J. Savino, a former labor activist who represents parts of Staten Island and Brooklyn; and David J. Valesky of the Syracuse area. Mr. Klein outlined a system in which the leaders of the Republican caucus and the Independent Democratic Conference would work together to run the Senate, with joint control over committee agendas, the bills that are taken up on the floor and state budget negotiations. The \u201ctime has come for coalition government,\u201d Mr. Klein said. \u201cOn the political end, it\u2019s always going to be close in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans. So it just makes sense to have some type of coalition government to remove the politics \u2014 the constant hyperpartisan bickering \u2014 and get things done in a bipartisan fashion.\u201d Democrats and some liberal leaders have accused Mr. Klein of wanting nothing more than to amass power for himself. But Mr. Klein said that was not his motivation. He wants his group \u201cto be influential, yes, but influential on policy,\u201d he said \u2014 and he rejected the suggestion that he was somehow betraying Democrats. \u201cWe\u2019re not empowering a Republican majority; we\u2019re talking about a coalition government,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI consider myself a very good Democrat.\u201d Mr. Klein, noting that same-sex marriage was defeated when Democrats controlled the Senate and then approved under Republican control, said he believed that a coalition government would also have a better chance of passing legislation sought by liberals, like an increase in the minimum wage, an overhaul of campaign-finance laws and reproductive-health measures. Senator Michael N. Gianaris, a Queens Democrat who led his party\u2019s campaign effort, disagreed.\u201cThe only way that the truly progressive agenda can be enacted is with a real Democratic majority,\u201d Mr. Gianaris said. \u201cSenator Klein\u2019s career has been one that has been true to Democratic values, and I would hope that we would find a way to come together in the best interest of the people of the state, because on issue after issue, it\u2019s the Senate Republicans that have stood in the way of progress, and that\u2019s not going to change,\u201d he added. But Republicans, who are eager to retain control of the Senate in a state where Democratic voters dominate the electorate, have embraced the independent Democrats. Senator Skelos described Mr. Klein as a \u201cserious and effective legislator.\u201d \u201cTogether, we\u2019ve ended the dysfunction in the Senate,\u201d Mr. Skelos said, adding, \u201cI expect to continue working with him to deliver the bipartisan results New Yorkers need and deserve.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/27\/business\/global\/euro-finance-ministers-confront-a-standoff-over-greece.html","body":"BRUSSELS \u2014 Finance ministers from the euro zone and the International Monetary Fund patched up their differences over a bailout for Greece early Tuesday with a spate of measures bringing closer the release of long-delayed emergency aid.The parties reached the deal after their third meeting in three weeks aimed at finding alternative ways of giving Greece relief in light of opposition by creditors like Germany and the Netherlands to so-called haircuts that would involve forgiving some Greek debt. The decisions \u201cwill certainly reduce the uncertainty and strengthen confidence in Europe and in Greece,\u201d Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said as he left the meeting. For Greece, the agreement means euro zone ministers have unlocked loan installments totaling 43.7 billion euros ($56.7 billion). Most of that money would start to be paid out in December, with further payments during the first quarter of next year on the condition that Greece continued to fulfill its pledges under the bailout plan. \u201cGreece has already come a very, very long way and tonight the Eurogroup has rightly recognized that,\u201d said Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, referring to the group of finance ministers who met here. But officials, including Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, said the payout would be made only once one part of the agreement \u2014 a debt buyback \u2014 had been completed. During the talks, which lasted about 12 hours, the I.M.F. pressed ministers to agree that Greece\u2019s debt should be cut by about 20 percent of G.D.P. through methods that include the debt buyback program at discounted prices, lowering interest rates, lengthening the deadlines for debt repayments, and returning profits to Greece made on bonds bought by the European Central Bank. In exchange, the I.M.F. compromised by loosening its debt target to about 124 percent of Greece\u2019s gross domestic product by the end of the decade. The fund had been insisting on a target of 120 percent by 2020. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the I.M.F., emphasized at a news conference that agreement had also been reached to ensure Greek debt was \u201csubstantially lower\u201d than 110 percent of G.D.P. by 2022. \u201cWhat remains to be done is a lot of nitty-gritty work, of course \u2014 national parliaments are going to have to consult with their respective authorities,\u201d said Ms. Lagarde, referring to steps that needed to be taken to release aid beginning next month. The haggling has been going on against the background of a financial catastrophe unfolding in Greece, where the economy has shrunk by about one-fifth in three years and unemployment is hovering around 25 percent. The unrelenting gloom means suffering for the Greek public and also made it more improbable that the country can pay its debts in full. The seemingly endless round of meetings over Greece has been a sign that after nearly three years of crises, the politicians are still trying to contain contagion in the euro zone, which began with a huge hole in Greek accounts, even as that country\u2019s debt prospects continue to worsen. In June, creditors froze aid from the current program, valued at 130 billion euros ($169 billion), after determining that Greece was failing to meet the conditions of that bailout, its second. Since then, \u201cGreece has fully delivered its part of the agreement, so we expect our partners to deliver their part, too,\u201d Yannis Stournaras, the Greek finance minister, said Monday before the meeting. But because of factors like worsening economic conditions, delays to fiscal reforms and disappointing earnings from the privatizations of state companies, Greek debt is now estimated at 175 percent of G.D.P., and its economy could shrink again, pushing that figure to 190 percent next year, and even up to 200 percent by 2014. The negative outlook has made earlier calls by the I.M.F. that Greece pare its debt to 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020 look unfeasible under current plans. That led the I.M.F. to increase pressure on major creditors like Germany to take politically unpalatable losses, or haircuts, on their holdings of Greek debt to keep the country in the euro zone. The result had been a standoff, with Germany trying to keep the bill for Greece as low as possible at least until after the German elections in 2013. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/27\/business\/global\/a-fleeting-hint-of-softening-in-germanys-debt-stance.html","body":"PARIS \u2014 Three years into the euro zone\u2019s debt crisis, the finance minister of Germany hinted tantalizingly at a potential breakthrough. Behind closed doors at a meeting in Paris last week of a small group of senior policy makers, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble indicated that Berlin could eventually agree to write off some of the money it has lent to Greece, helping the country to make its debt sustainable. Three people present or briefed on the talks said Mr. Sch\u00e4uble had suggested there could be some kind of \u201cconditional debt relief\u201d for Athens if it stuck to tough economic overhauls. But Mr. Sch\u00e4uble backtracked within 24 hours. The idea, aired publicly this month by the German central bank chief, Jens Weidmann, could be a game-changer in the crisis because for the first time it offers the prospect of European countries\u2019 sharing losses with the aim of making Greece viable in the long run. But it is politically explosive in Germany, where many lawmakers, jurists and commentators fiercely oppose any idea of a \u201ctransfer union,\u201d in which wealthier northern European Union states subsidize or underwrite weaker southern partners. Mr. Sch\u00e4uble told his peers from France, Spain and Italy as well as Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, that Berlin would be willing to consider a Greek debt write-down, not now but at a later stage, said the people, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the deliberations. That pointed to a possible review of Greece\u2019s financial situation sometime after a general election in Germany next year and before a second Greek bailout program is to expire in 2016. The next day, at a wider meeting of euro zone finance ministers, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble ruled out any debt forgiveness, leaving some of his interlocutors baffled. In public he said that an official debt write-off would be illegal, and Germany would no longer be able to lend money to Greece. The I.M.F., some senior European Central Bank policy makers and many economists argue that Greece\u2019s official lenders will eventually be forced to take losses because the country\u2019s ratio of debt to gross domestic product continues to mount despite a big write-down earlier this year by private creditors. An unpublished analysis prepared for the finance ministers showed Greek debt would peak at 190 percent of G.D.P. next year and fall to 144 percent in 2020, far above the target of 120 percent set by the I.M.F. and European lenders. Euro zone ministers are considering lending Greece more money to buy back its own debt at a discount; reducing interest rates on official loans and extending their maturities; granting an interest repayment holiday; and passing profits on E.C.B. purchases of Greek bonds back to Athens. The moribund market in Greek government bonds has twitched back to life at the prospect, with prices rising to about 35 cents on the euro in anticipation of a possible buyback. But E.U. officials say all these measures would not be enough to meet the debt sustainability target. Ms. Lagarde has said she wants \u201ca real fix, not a quick fix\u201d to Greece\u2019s indebtedness and has held back the release of the next installment of \u20ac31 billion, or $40 billion, to Athens, hoping to force the Europeans to devise a lasting solution. She rejected letting the target date for Greece to cut its debt to G.D.P. ratio slide by two years to 2022. Diplomats involved in the negotiations said Ms. Lagarde was looking for a signal from Germany. Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s closed-door comment may have been that signal. But it is not clear whether he had Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s support in talking about debt relief or had exceeded his authority and been pulled back into line. \u201cIt turns out that Sch\u00e4uble may have exceeded his mandate from the Chancellery, if he had one,\u201d an E.U. official briefed on the meeting said. But the official said that the idea of European governments\u2019 absorbing losses had been introduced into the discussion. Apart from the political sensitivity of losing taxpayer money on Greece, Ms. Merkel sees three objections to a debt write-down: the legality, a lack of a precedent and the blow it would deal to investor confidence. A legal opinion ordered by the German government suggests a haircut, or losses on loans, would breach both the \u201cno-bailout\u201d clause in the European Union treaty and the German budget law, which bars lending to a country that may be unable to pay back the debt. Any write-down would most likely be challenged in the Constitutional Court in Germany, which has already clipped Berlin\u2019s wings in the crisis, and perhaps in the European Court of Justice. Forgiving Greek debt could draw copycat requests from states like Portugal and Ireland, which are implementing similar bailout programs with less kicking and screaming. Ms. Merkel is also concerned that investors like the Chinese, who felt betrayed when euro zone leaders forced a haircut on the private holders of Greek bonds, would be even more alarmed if they saw a second write-down of European sovereign debt. But Mr. Weidmann of the Bundesbank said that a haircut on government loans to Greece could make sense as a reward for completing economic overhauls and to help Athens regain access to capital markets. The risk is that it would be so hard for Germany and other northern European states to get a debt write-down through their parliaments that the scale of relief might be too small to help Greece. One source in the thick of euro zone crisis management said it would make sense to \u201cbite the bullet\u201d and cut Greece\u2019s debt by a substantial amount. But political constraints made it more likely that any relief would be gauged to reduce the debt level to 100 percent to 110 percent of G.D.P. by the target date.

A single-minded political veteran who commands both fear and respect in the Indian civil service, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram is squeezing government ministries hard to cut spending wherever they can and quickly, to help control a growing fiscal deficit. He is a man under pressure and with an eye on the clock. Four weeks ago, he set himself an ambitious target: to hold the government\u2019s fiscal deficit for 2012-13 to 5.3 percent of gross domestic product; private economists forecast a deficit closer to 6 percent. But setbacks since Oct. 29 in the raising of revenue will make it almost impossible for the government to meet that target, economists say, and some Finance Ministry officials privately agree. That increases the risk that ratings agencies could reduce the government\u2019s debt to junk status in the coming months. \u201cThis has taken on a very great sense of urgency,\u201d said Rajiv Biswas, chief Asia economist at IHS, a market research company. He called on Mr. Chidambaram to draw up a credible plan for cutting the deficit. The deficit reduction plan Mr. Chidambaram announced last month was criticized by economists as short on specifics and protective of fuel subsidies and expensive social welfare programs for the country\u2019s millions of poor people. A month earlier, a deficit reduction panel appointed by Mr. Chidambaram had urged the government to cut such spending. They said India was on the edge of a \u201cfiscal precipice\u201d and the economy was \u201cflashing red lights.\u201d The government is pursuing a \u201cBand-Aid approach\u201d to deficit reduction, favoring quick fixes instead of structural changes to cut the deficit, said Rajeev Malik, an economist at the investment bank CLSA in Singapore, who is sticking to a deficit forecast of 6 percent of the Indian gross domestic product. The expectation in financial markets that the Indian government will overshoot its deficit target and reach 5.6 percent of G.D.P. helped push benchmark 10-year bond yields late last week to their highest level in nearly three months. But the big unknown is the response of the ratings agencies, which have repeatedly warned India to get its finances in order. Analysts said the agencies were unlikely to disclose their thinking until after Mr. Chidambaram announced his budget, which is expected in February. But in October, the ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s said India still faced a one-in-three chance of a downgrade within the next two years. Such an outcome would hurt investor sentiment and push overseas borrowing costs up for Indian companies. Mr. Chidambaram, 67, charmed financial markets with his can-do attitude and burst of economic changes in September after years of policy inaction by the weak coalition government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The Indian benchmark BSE stock index rallied about 6 percent after the changes were announced in mid-September. But concerns about implementation, the deficit and declining inflows of foreign funds have since pushed the index down 3.3 percent. \u201cWe believe that this is the beginning of the realization that a sustainable turnaround in India\u2019s growth prospects would require considerable effort, well beyond the burst of measures seen in September,\u201d Deutsche Bank said last week in an note with the headline, \u201cReality Check.\u201d Mr. Chidambaram\u2019s deficit reduction plan banks heavily on raising billions of dollars by auctioning cellphone airwaves and selling shares in state companies. Neither effort is going well. The government raised less than a quarter of its target of 400 billion rupees, or $7.3 billion, in an auction of second-generation spectrums in mid-November. A second auction is planned before March, but a senior official said there would probably be a shortfall of at least 200 billion rupees. India succeeded in raising 8.1 billion rupees by selling shares of the state-run Hindustan Copper on Friday, although the deal was supported by buying from state institutions. To put the deal in context: New Delhi wants to raise 300 billion rupees by selling shares in state companies this fiscal year, which ends in March. Excluding the latest sale, it has managed just 1.25 billion rupees so far. The government is staring at an overall shortfall of nearly 500 billion rupees in revenue this year, the senior official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. This may require additional borrowing from the market. Mr. Chidambaram\u2019s battle to tame the deficit takes place against the backdrop of a continued economic slowdown, and a fractious Parliament, where the government has lost its majority after its biggest coalition ally withdrew support in opposition to the economic changes. Manufacturing is contracting and exports are falling. The Indian trade deficit in October of nearly $21 billion was the worst on record. And a second round of changes aimed at liberalizing the pension and insurance sectors has been stalled by the gridlock in Parliament. It is not clear whether the measures, long sought by investors, will be passed in the current winter session. But Mr. Chidambaram, who began his second stint as finance minister in August, gives no appearance of being disheartened, and as recently as Saturday was confidently predicting he would be able to contain the deficit to 5.3 percent of G.D.P. Inside his ministry, officials said the target looked daunting, but they have had no word of a revision from the minister. Instead, he has intensified pressure on them to find ways of meeting the target, they said."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/27\/opinion\/catalonia-texas-and-scotland-move-toward-independence.html","body":"LondonBANNERS at FC Barcelona\u2019s Camp Nou soccer stadium have long declared: \u201cCatalonia is not Spain.\u201d That notion got a boost this weekend as pro-independence parties won Catalonian elections and strengthened the region\u2019s drive for a referendum on secession in defiance of the Spanish Constitution and of Mariano Rajoy, the embattled center-right prime minister. Indeed, such is Spain\u2019s economic crisis that Rajoy declared in June that \u201cSpain is not Uganda,\u201d prompting the Ugandan foreign minister to retort the next day that, \u201cUganda does not want to be Spain!\u201d So a majority of Catalonia\u2019s 7.5 million citizens, it seems, no longer want to be in Spain \u2014 and a majority of Ugandans would rather be in Uganda. The crisis of the euro zone has accentuated longstanding Catalonian resentment over tax transfers to Madrid and sharpened the nationalism of the region with the biggest economy in Spain \u2014 larger than Greece\u2019s, as Catalans like to point out. (Elena Salgado, the former Spanish finance minister, noted in 2010 that, \u201cSpain is not Greece.\u201d Later that year, clearly irked, the then Greek finance minister declared that, \u201cGreece is not Ireland.\u201d The former Irish finance minister, Brian Lenihan, retorted that \u201cIreland is not in Greek territory.\u201d Meanwhile, the secretary general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development weighed in: \u201cNeither Spain nor Portugal is Ireland.\u201d) The euro crisis is also a crisis of euro-geography. Scotland has scheduled for 2014 a referendum on independence, 307 years after the political union that created the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom mutters about withdrawal from the European Union. So much for globalization, the disappearance of frontiers in Europe, borderless cyberworlds, hyperconnectivity and all the forces that seem to make a mockery of the nation-state and a case, at some point, for global governance. People are bored and irked. They can\u2019t get new jobs. They want new borders, especially as the likelihood of actually having to defend them in war has become infinitely remote. They want to be cyberglobal and hyper-local, citizens of the world with the passports of microstates. The desires seem to balance each other. Across the Atlantic there are similar trends. In Texas \u2014 where Mitt Romney won by nearly 1.3 million votes \u2014 secession chatter has increased. Larry Scott Kilgore, a Republican candidate, has announced he will run for governor in 2014 and legally change his name to Larry Secede Kilgore. Texans, betraying an unlikely European itch, like to point out that the Texas economy is larger than Australia\u2019s [pdf]. Australia, meanwhile, has many citizens of Greek descent but is definitely not Greece. As Tom Wolfe writes in his new novel, \u201cIt\u2019s back to blood! Religion is dying ... but everybody still has to believe in something . It would be intolerable \u2014 you couldn\u2019t stand it ... to finally have to say to yourself, \u2018Why keep pretending? I\u2019m nothing but a random atom inside a supercollider known as the universe.\u201d\u2019 As economic difficulties increase so do tribal sentiments. Random-atom angst sends people scurrying for new flags even as 800 million borderless cyberfolk unite in watching \u201cGangnam Style\u201d on YouTube. Of course, immigration, lust and love have mixed the blood of the Scottish, Texan and Catalonian tribes (Call them \u201cScottexalonia\u201d in their shared separation itch.) \u201cI\u2019m a mutt,\u201d Barack Obama once said. So, increasingly, is a wired, remittance-linked world where many live with, say, one foot in Birmingham and another in Lahore. Glasgow has a substantial Muslim population. Texas is more than a third Hispanic. Catalonia has many Spanish-only speaking immigrants. The urge to throw up new borders is in essence an anachronism. Or is it? The euro crisis is perceived as a crisis of overreach for pooled sovereignty. Perhaps a reaction is rational (even if the Catalans and Scots say they would like to be in the E.U., once they run their own affairs.) Economic resentment translates into a resurgence of identity with national culture. In Texas, where the terms of entry into the Union in 1845 are still debated, it is a little different. The main resentments are social not economic. Cohabiting with all the pointy-headed, Subaru-driving, pro-choice liberals who elected Obama is too much for some Texans. In 1996, I began a piece called \u201cGlobal forces batter politics\u201d with these words: \u201cThroughout much of the world today, politics lags behind economics, like a horse and buggy haplessly trailing a sports car. While politicians go through the motions of national elections \u2014 offering chimerical programs and slogans \u2014 world markets, the Internet and the furious pace of trade involve people in a global game in which elected representatives figure as little more than bit players.\u201d Extrapolate out 16 years from that. National politics, as President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France is only the latest to discover, is often no more than tweaking at the margins in the exiguous political space left by markets and other global forces. And that is in France! Secessionist urges resonate in troubled times. But they face the headwind of business, political and global logic. I suspect that \u2014 less Kosovo than Quebec \u2014 all of Scottexalonia will succumb eventually to the good sense of union.

Home after home torn apart by the ocean. Streets filled with sand. Shattered sidewalks and clogged sewers. A sea wall, which had already been inadequate to the task of safeguarding residents, reduced to rubble.Ordinarily, New York City or other governmental entities might take over the tasks of restoring a middle-class neighborhood like this. But Sea Gate, with its 850 homes on Coney Island\u2019s western tip, is not an ordinary neighborhood. It is a 113-year-old private, gated community, where the razor-wire-topped fences and armed security checkpoints that keep outsiders from its streets, beaches and parks serve as a constant reminder that the residents of this community have chosen to live somewhat apart. Once the gilded retreat of the Vanderbilt family, Sea Gate, like other gated communities in New York, preserved its exclusivity with the promise that the residents would assume the costs of community upkeep, maintaining their own streets, parks and sewer systems and even fielding the distinct Sea Gate Police Department. The special status endured, through occasional controversy and political efforts to open the streets to the public, because of the community\u2019s self-sufficiency. But the damage inflicted by Hurricane Sandy to Sea Gate, in Brooklyn, and another gated community, Breezy Point, in Queens, was so monumental that residents who are already struggling to figure out how they will pay to rebuild their homes say they cannot afford to pay the additional cost of repairing communal infrastructure. So neighborhoods that have long held the rest of the city at arm\u2019s length now seek the financial embrace of the city, state and federal governments. That turnaround has been ill-received among some on the other side of the fence from Sea Gate, in historically troubled apartment towers like Sea Rise, where Cesar Catala, 29, picked up some hot food from a relief tent on Monday. \u201cThey seclude themselves,\u201d said Mr. Catala, who has lived in Coney Island nearly his entire life. \u201cWe don\u2019t have problems with Sea Gate, but they put their noses down at us. We get treated like we\u2019re second class, just because they live in houses and we live in the projects and we rent. They say they need assistance and, fine, maybe they do need assistance. But they have insurance on their houses. We don\u2019t have insurance. We don\u2019t have much out here.\u201d In Breezy Point, a gated community on the western edge of the Rockaways, 111 homes burned to the ground during the storm. \u201cWe\u2019d be foolish not to ask for help,\u201d said Steve Greenberg, former chairman of the Breezy Point cooperative\u2019s board and a financial adviser at Morgan Stanley. \u201cWe would hope that we see something, but if we don\u2019t see something we\u2019re prepared to go forward to keep the community.\u201d Leaving aside the policy question of whether flood-prone communities should be rebuilt at all, these insular areas pose unusual challenges for public agencies. Community officials have long maintained that their enclaves are no different than a Park Avenue apartment house with its own doorman, a horizontal rather than a vertical development. But, to continue the analogy, apartment buildings do not ask the city to retile their hallways or fix their plumbing. The residents of gated communities pay all the same taxes \u2014 sewer, water and property \u2014 that any city property owner does, in addition to their private association charges. But the city does not appear to have a formal obligation to provide services, like road and sewer maintenance, for the infrastructure that gated communities agreed to maintain. \u201cNow, with this unexpected act of God, those same communities, quite ready to point a finger at government shortcomings, are placed in the difficult position of having to reach out to government for a substantial helping hand,\u201d said Paula A. Franzese, a law professor at Seton Hall University who has written extensively about gated communities. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb Matthew Wolfe contributed reporting."},{"url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9C05E5DC153BF934A15752C1A9649D8B63","body":"The Brooklyn Academy of Music, known for its adventurous offerings across cultural disciplines, like \"Red, black & GREEN: a blues\" (a recent show about black environmentalists) and Ivo van Hove's \"Roman Tragedies\" (an epic created by merging three Shakespeare plays), is more than doubling its programming for children and families.

Carney loves a challenge.Mr. Carney, the chief of Canada\u2019s central bank, who was named the next governor of the Bank of England on Monday, contrasted the current smooth operation of Canada\u2019s financial services and monetary system with the problems in Britain. \u201cI see this as a challenge, and I\u2019m going to where the challenge is the greatest,\u201d he said in a news conference with Jim Flaherty, Canada\u2019s finance minister. The word was brought up again by Ian Lee, a professor at the Sprott School of Business at Carleton University in Ottawa, who said that while he was surprised by the timing of the Bank of England\u2019s announcement, he was not at all surprised that Mr. Carney was seeking a bigger challenge outside of Canada. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t see him remaining here,\u201d Professor Lee said, \u201cbecause there just aren\u2019t enough challenges for him in Canada.\u201d He added that Mr. Carney was \u201cgoing from coasting here to dealing with a ton of challenges.\u201d Having spent much of a career in investment banking with Goldman Sachs, Mr. Carney was an unusual figure in the Canadian public service, which has relatively few people in crucial positions with extensive private sector experience. Ever since Mr. Carney was named the governor of the Bank of Canada in late 2007, a move that was also something of a surprise at the time, he has developed unusual public prominence. Photogenic and fit thanks to running, Mr. Carney is a dynamic contrast to other key financial industry players as well as most federal politicians. There has been occasional speculation that Mr. Carney would try to become prime minister by taking over the leadership of the once powerful but now struggling Liberal Party. There is no obvious evidence, however, that Mr. Carney is a Liberal or that he holds any interest in elected office. Since the financial crisis of 2008, Canada has basked in self-congratulations over the stability of its financial institutions and its credit markets. While Mr. Carney and the Bank of Canada were key contributors to that situation, the actual regulation and supervision of banks and other financial institutions was the responsibility of other agencies that report to the Department of Finance. \u201cHe had a very important impact,\u201d Professor Lee said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not going to tell you that if it was not for Carney we would have been like Europe.\u201d Mr. Carney\u2019s chief contribution, he added, came in taking a wide set of economic reforms Canada had adopted over 15 to 20 years and then \u201craising it several notches\u201d by promoting its concepts through speeches and media interviews. During the post-2008 enmity toward banks, Professor Lee said, Mr. Carney acted as the country\u2019s \u201cvoice of reason.\u201d Mr. Carney\u2019s intellect and the personal wealth he accumulated while working at Goldman Sachs, Professor Lee said, gave him the confidence to challenge both governments and powerful private sector financial institutions. In public presentations, Mr. Carney often mixes the arcane and academic (he left Goldman at one point to obtain a doctorate in economics at Oxford) with blunt talk. Although he works closely with the current Conservative government, Mr. Carney has publicly offered remarks that were well outside of its positions. Most notably he told a television interviewer last year that the Occupy protests were an \u201centirely constructive\u201d response to growing economic inequality. More recently, Mr. Carney angered many Canadian corporate leaders after he criticized them for accumulating cash that he termed \u201cdead money.\u201d Mr. Carney added: \u201cTheir job is to put money to work, and if they can\u2019t think of what to do with it, they should give it back to their shareholders.\u201d While Mr. Carney\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes Harvard, where he played hockey as an undergraduate, as well as Goldman Sachs and Oxford, he comes from a relatively modest middle-class background. He was born in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, where his father was a schoolteacher at the time, and then moved to Edmonton, Alberta, as a child. During his time at the bank, Mr. Carney has taken pains not to seem like a member of the country\u2019s elite. When he agreed to participate in a weekly interview feature of The Globe and Mail, a national Canadian newspaper, that is always conducted over lunch, Mr. Carney avoided the usual fancy restaurant in favor of a hamburger grill near his Ottawa neighborhood. Within the financial sector, he has a reputation for being sharp-tongued with people who do not meet his expectations. Mr. Carney did not make it entirely clear during his news conference in Ottawa what he had offered, other than experience, that no one in Britain did for the Bank of England job. But he did note the time he spent in England with Goldman and at Oxford and that his wife and four daughters are dual British-Canadian citizens. \u201cI know a lot of people in the city, in the industry, in the United Kingdom,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously I think I can play a constructive role in relaunching this institution with its new responsibilities.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/27\/nyregion\/after-effort-to-open-doors-for-others-a-capitalist-is-locked-out.html","body":"As a child in Chicago, Tarrus Richardson clipped newspaper articles about Reginald Lewis, a financier who would become the first African-American to run a billion-dollar business. Mr. Richardson\u2019s father, a Vietnam veteran, started a popcorn business, and made Tarrus a shareholder at age 8. Mr. Richardson went on to Harvard Business School, and with his friend, Willie Woods, opened an investment firm, ICV Capital Partners, specializing in inner-city companies, in 1998. They were among the firms chosen during the past decade to invest a portion of New York State\u2019s $250 billion pension fund assets.Mr. Richardson was a young capitalist on the rise. In 2010, he helped organize a broad coalition to support legislation to open doors for blacks, Latinos and women in the nearly all-white worlds of finance, including establishing goals for minority and female participation in pension investments. Dozens of young black financiers lobbied in Albany. The New York State comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, a liberal Democrat, had reservations about the legislation. Testy words were passed, but compromises were reached. Then Gov. David A. Paterson, legislators and Mr. DiNapoli smiled as it was signed into law. The next day, a senior official with the comptroller\u2019s office tried to get Mr. Richardson fired. Tyson A. Pratcher, an assistant comptroller who helps oversee state pension funds, summoned Mr. Woods, the managing partner of ICV, to his office and got blunt. \u201cHey, it\u2019s going to be tough doing business with somebody who has somebody like Tarrus on their team,\u201d Mr. Pratcher reportedly said. In the same conversation, Mr. Pratcher complained that Mr. Richardson pushed too hard for the legislation. \u201cHow\u2019s he doing this job and doing all this legislation?\u201d Mr. Pratcher reportedly demanded of Mr. Woods. \u201cHow\u2019s he effective in his job?\u201d Mr. Richardson, in fact, was one of the top investment performers in his firm. A short time later, Mr. Woods recalled, another official with the comptroller\u2019s office told him that lobbying against \u201cyour largest investors\u201d was a big problem. Within a month, Mr. Woods fired his friend Tarrus Richardson. All of this is laid out in a lawsuit that Mr. Richardson filed last week in federal court in Manhattan, and in a deposition that Mr. Woods gave several years ago in an arbitration case. The arbitrator directed Mr. Woods to pay $4.7 million to Mr. Richardson in compensation for his dismissal. Asked about Mr. Richardson\u2019s lawsuit, the comptroller\u2019s office released a distancing statement: \u201cThe New York State Common Retirement Fund was not involved in any decision about his employment status at ICV.\u201d But two sources familiar with this case said that the comptroller\u2019s office\u2019s displeasure with Mr. Richardson was widely known, and that high-ranking officials in that office complained vigorously about other professionals who lobbied for the bills. These sources asked to remain unnamed for fear of retaliation. There was a legitimate policy debate to be had over the 2010 proposals. The comptroller feared that targets would amount to setting racial and gender quotas, and he persuaded legislators to strip these from the bill. And Mr. Richardson speaks well of Mr. DiNapoli. \u201cTo be frank, he had one of the more progressive investment policies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe sought to codify it so that we didn\u2019t have to depend on Mr. DiNapoli.\u201d But none of this explains why top public officials apparently tried to undermine investment professionals who spoke openly on questions of public policy. Mr. Richardson, in particular, is widely respected in black investment circles for his insistent commitment to social responsibility. When Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg gave his keynote speech in 2011, at the beginning of a $130 million effort to encourage young black men to get an education, he chose the offices of the Council of Urban Professionals, which Mr. Richardson helped found. A person close to the comptroller, speaking on the condition of anonymity, suggested that if you invest the state\u2019s money and take a policy stand that annoys staff members, you risk some blowback. \u201cHis arguments did not conform to our legal reading of what was possible,\u201d this person said. \u201cJust hypothetically, that could call into question his credibility and stewardship.\u201d No one has ever accused me of possessing an excess of financial acumen, but that strikes me as a leap into the abyss. If Goldman Sachs took a position that conflicted with the comptroller\u2019s legal reading, would Goldman Sachs lose credibility as an investment adviser? To ask that hypothetical question is to answer it. Mr. Richardson has a round face with close-cropped hair, flecked gray. His voice is corporate-suite soft. He lives in Harlem with his wife and two children. He pauses for long seconds before answering questions about his fall. \u201cThere\u2019s a greater chance this harms my future prospects more than it helps me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m super anxious about that.\u201d \u201cBut they\u2019ve harmed me and a much larger cause,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd there\u2019s not a soul in the world who will speak up.\u201d E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com Twitter: @powellnyt"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/26\/business\/treasury-auctions-set-for-this-week.html","body":"The Treasury\u2019s schedule of financing this week includes Monday\u2019s regular weekly auction of new three- and six-month bills and an auction of four-week and two-year bills on Tuesday.

Assume Athens is promised its next \u20ac44 billion in bailout cash and some further debt relief when euro zone finance ministers reconvene on Monday. Even then, the banks will still be hobbled, while another round of austerity measures are in the works and vested interests are active. It will be hard to restore confidence and, without that, there will not be a return to growth. Meanwhile, without growth, the fragile coalition government of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras will fall. The leftist Syriza movement led by Alexis Tsipras would then probably take over, plunging the country into a new phase of crisis. Plus, if investors and consumers fear such a scenario, they will not start spending, making a continuation of the slump likely. Mr. Samaras, who became prime minister in June, has been better than many feared. His strategy has been to do everything demanded of Greece by the troika of big lenders \u2014 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 in an effort to change the perception that Athens cannot be trusted. The prime minister had to make up a lot of lost ground, partly because of mistakes made by the government of George A. Papandreou and partly because Mr. Samaras himself was unwilling to get behind the overhaul program when he was in the opposition. Then he brought the technocratic administration of Lucas Papademos to a premature end. The shenanigans over the past year \u2014 Mr. Papandreou\u2019s aborted referendum over an international bailout, which was followed by two destabilizing elections \u2014 have savaged Greece\u2019s credibility. That said, Greece\u2019s recent \u201cgood behavior\u201d looks as if it will be rewarded with a cash injection and some debt relief. That will undoubtedly be good news, but it probably will not be enough. Most attention has been focused on the fact that Athens\u2019s debt will still be unsustainable because Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is unwilling to countenance a write-down of loans to Greece before German elections and the expectation that this will act as a drag on confidence and investment. But failure to make the banking system sustainable could be a bigger problem. Most of the \u20ac44 billion, or approximately $57 billion, in new cash will be used to recapitalize the banks. When that is added to capital provided during the summer, the system will have received \u20ac48 billion in total. Although this amounts to a quarter of Greece\u2019s gross domestic product, it probably will not be enough to handle two big problems: the banks\u2019 vast portfolio of Greek government bonds, which have already been written down once; and an avalanche of nonperforming loans to the private sector. Since the \u20ac48 billion figure was calculated last year, admittedly with a buffer, the economic outlook has deteriorated. The European Commission, for example, expects G.D.P. to be about 10 percent less at the end of 2013 than it did a year ago. Nobody, though, seems to want to look at the possibility that the banks will be undercapitalized \u2014 presumably because they don\u2019t have a clue about how to raise the extra money. Nor does anybody seem to be looking to create a \u201cbad bank\u201d to take over the viable banks\u2019 dud loans. Such a plan, which is being used in Ireland and Spain, is a tried and tested mechanism to free banks from the past and allow them to finance an economic recovery. El Pa\u00eds, the Spanish daily newspaper, reported Sunday that European authorities were ready to hand over \u20ac35 billion to a Spanish rescue fund in exchange for widespread layoffs at four nationalized banks. A probable lack of capital in the Greek financial system is not the only problem. The banks are also still relying on the E.C.B. and the Bank of Greece for about \u20ac135 billion in funding, after wholesale markets stopped financing them and many savers took out their deposits. The next installment of bailout cash will also be used to repay the government\u2019s unpaid bills \u2014 which are about \u20ac8 billion. But this will be swamped by the latest \u20ac13.5 billion fiscal squeeze. Meanwhile, Greece still needs to restore its competitiveness. The good news is that labor costs are collapsing and the current account deficit is shrinking. The bad news is that prices have not yet dropped, because the country\u2019s vested interests are exploiting their positions to hang onto excess profits. Given all this, the Greek economy \u2014 which has slumped 20 percent since the end of 2008 \u2014 will shrink again next year. The government should be able to survive that. The real problem will occur if the economy continues to contract into 2014. To some extent, the outcome is outside the control of Mr. Samaras. His best chance is to win acclamation with a determined onslaught on corruption, cartels and tax evasion. Greece may then eventually be rewarded with a bigger debt write-down, more cash to recapitalize its banks and a more efficient economy. There will also be less risk that it will need more austerity measures. It is unclear whether Mr. Samaras has the courage to confront the country\u2019s business lobbies, many of which support his conservative New Democracy party. But doing so would give him a claim to a place in the history books.

He calculated that one student each year cost the Belgian government about \u20ac10,000, or nearly $13,000. \u201cIt is problematic if we have a large group of students from outside our society that we need to finance,\u201d Mr. Vercruysse said. \u201cMost of the Dutch students go back to the Netherlands.\u201d His criticism reflected a broader concern about how European nations should share the cost of educating their students. \u201cIt\u2019s the sort of story that you see at the beginning of almost every academic year in countries around Europe,\u201d Adam Tyson, head of higher education at the Directorate General for Education and Culture, part of the European Commission, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThere were questions about German students\u2019 going to Austria to study medicine and dentistry for a few years. There are flows all around Europe. There are German and British students coming into the Netherlands. Within the Nordic countries, there\u2019s a quite large flow from Sweden and Finland into Denmark.\u201d After Mr. Vercruysse\u2019s comments, newspapers reported that the number of Dutch students crossing over to Flanders \u2014 a Dutch-speaking part of Belgium \u2014 had increased every year for a decade and was expected to rise further in 2012-13. Tuition at universities in the Netherlands costs \u20ac1,771, compared with \u20ac578 in Belgium. As in most of continental Europe, university education is financed almost entirely by taxpayers, making tuition relatively low compared with countries like the United States or Britain. Mr. Vercruysse was reprimanded for speaking out of turn and Belgian officials dismissed his comments. He declined to be interviewed for this article. \u201cAt the time this public servant was saying that, he was a little confused,\u201d the Flemish education minister, Pascal Smet, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t see it as a problem today. If we really want a Europe of tomorrow, it\u2019s only logical that people will go study in other member states.\u201d The number of students crossing the border is still relatively small. Mr. Smet said 5,573 Dutch citizens were receiving their education in Belgium, which is 2.6 percent of the Belgian student population. The proportion has doubled from 1.3 percent 10 years ago. \u201cThe figures are not that problematic at this time,\u201d Mr. Smet said, \u201cbut we see that the numbers are mounting, so we do need to monitor it.\u201d European student mobility is a key principle of the Bologna Process, which seeks to promote exchanges among the 47 nations of the European Higher Education Area. The European courts have confirmed that students from participating nations must be granted the same rights and privileges, including identical study fees, in any other member nation. The issue is expected to arise in Berlin next week at the first meeting of the Bologna Process Working Group on Mobility. Despite efforts to minimize the issue in Belgium, it has not gone away. \u201cYou hear it in papers, you hear it from political parties, and you hear it also when people speak about budget cuts and links to the economic situation,\u201d said Ludo Melis, vice president for educational policy at the University of Leuven. The largest university in Belgium, it has 40,000 students, including 1,600 Dutch citizens. \u201cYou don\u2019t have it in daily life \u2014 Dutch students do not report problems in living in Belgian towns,\u201d Mr. Melis said. \u201cIt\u2019s only in public debates and in papers and questions to the minister.\u201d Kris Van Dijck, a member of the Flemish Parliament on the education committee, called for a sense of proportion. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/26\/business\/economy\/economic-reports-for-the-week-of-nov-26.html","body":"ECONOMIC REPORTS Data scheduled to be released include durable goods for October, the Standard & Poor\u2019s\/Case-Shiller housing price index and consumer confidence for November (Tuesday); new home sales for October and the Federal Reserve beige book, weekly jobless claims, third-quarter gross domestic product (revised) and pending home sales for October (Thursday); and personal income and spending for October and the Chicago Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index for November (Friday).

He was about to lay down millions more. Randy Polumbo, an artist and friend, had persuaded Mr. Rechnitz to tour the Gowanus space, known by locals as the Batcave, thinking that it would be a good home for Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s growing art collection and for artists\u2019 studios. A representative of the owner and a real estate broker had come along, Mr. Polumbo recalled in a recent interview. Mr. Rechnitz asked how many studio spaces could be created in the building if his art were not shown there, Mr. Polumbo said. Perhaps 50 or 60, he remembered saying. \u201cWhen I said this, his eyes lit up, and he said, \u2018That is what we will do,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Polumbo said. \u201cWithin a week of that visit, we were in negotiation to buy it.\u201d No formal announcement was made after Mr. Rechnitz bought the Batcave for what, according to property records, was $7 million. The move appeared to surprise even those working closely with him. \u201cHe wants to develop a space for artists to create and display art,\u201d Maureen Connelly, a former press secretary for Mayor Edward I. Koch who has been Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s spokeswoman on the velodrome project, said shortly after the purchase. \u201cThat\u2019s all I know about that project.\u201d Shy by nature, Mr. Rechnitz, 47, has avoided public attention for his projects \u2014 that is, as much as possible for someone making what at the time amounted to the largest single donation ever made to city parks. (It has since been surpassed by a $100 million gift given to Central Park by John A. Paulson.) He has never appeared in public to discuss the plan and has declined all requests for interviews, including for this article, referring all questions to Ms. Connelly. \u201cHe\u2019s been locked up in a box,\u201d said Michael Green, who knew Mr. Rechnitz from his days as an amateur bicycle racer in Central Park. That strategy has not always worked in his favor. News media outlets looking for a photograph of Mr. Rechnitz after the announcement resorted to one of the only pictures they could find: an image of Mr. Rechnitz, hair sticking out from under a knitted cap, taken from a 2009 video interview. Mr. Rechnitz had tried to get the video taken down before and after the announcement, said Suzannah B. Troy, 50, an artist who shot the clip and posted it on YouTube. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you would please take that video down,\u201d he wrote to her in July in an e-mail, which she provided to The New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty unflattering shot the media grabbed from the video.\u201d She refused. \u201cIt\u2019s authentic; you look like a Williamsburg hipster,\u201d she remembered telling him. (Ms. Connelly later released a more buttoned-up studio portrait.) The field-house plan has drawn criticism from some neighborhood groups in Brooklyn Heights who believe their quiet streets would be overrun with traffic from the proposed sports complex, which would include a 200-meter wooden cycling track and space for thousands to attend competitions with little space for parking. Others have questioned the need for such a project for an obscure sport. \u201cIt\u2019s just so self-evident that this is his personal passion,\u201d said Peter Flemming, co-chairman of the Brooklyn Bridge Park Community Council and one of the most outspoken critics of the plan. \u201cThe track-cycling community is devout, I\u2019m sure. The snowboard community is devout, too. There\u2019s no sport that doesn\u2019t have its devotees.\u201d Mr. Flemming added, \u201cHe\u2019s paying for his building, and then the city gets stuck with it.\u201d But friends of Mr. Rechnitz said he was serious about trying to create a site the community could use, while also building a track. \u201cJosh has got a big heart,\u201d said Matthew Heitmann, who was a partner with Mr. Rechnitz in an earlier version of the velodrome plan. \u201cI think he wants to do a lot of good.\u201d Mr. Rechnitz was born on June 2, 1965, in Red Bank, N.J., into a fortune amassed by his grandfather, Robert H. Heilbrunn, who invested in undervalued companies beginning during the Depression. 1 2 3 Next Page \u00bb This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: December 2, 2012An article in some editions last Sunday about Joshua Rechnitz, the philanthropist who has pledged $40 million to build a field house centered on a bicycling velodrome in Brooklyn Bridge Park, misspelled the surname of the chairman of the real estate consulting firm HR&A Advisors, who helped to get the architecture critic Paul Goldberger involved in the selection of an architect for the project.

One is stupid, the other is evil. And when they join forces to do something that\u2019s both stupid and evil \u2014 well, that\u2019s what we call \u201cbipartisanship.\u201dThe payroll tax holiday that passed Congress in the winter of 2010 was a rare exception to this pessimistic rule. Cutting the payroll tax was good short-term politics for both Democrats and Republicans: it was a tax cut that liberals hoped would double as stimulus, and a boost to the middle class that conservatives could support without embracing new federal spending. But more important, it opened the door to what would be good long-term policy as well \u2014 because more than almost any feature of the American tax code, the payroll tax deserves to be pared away into extinction. But now Washington is in danger of practicing payroll-tax bipartisanship of a more destructive sort. While the White House and Congressional Republicans wrestle over where to set income tax rates and how and whether to cut spending, the payroll tax holiday has been orphaned. Lacking noisy champions and press attention, it\u2019s in danger of expiring at the end of the year out of political indifference. That outcome would be unfortunate. Payroll taxes are a relic of New Deal Machiavellianism: by taking a bite of every worker\u2019s paycheck and promising postretirement returns, Franklin Roosevelt effectively disguised Social Security as a pay-as-you-go system, even though the program actually redistributes from rich to poor and young to old. That disguise has helped keep Social Security sacrosanct \u2014 hailed by Democrats because it protects the poor and backed by Republicans as a reward for steady work. But the costs of this disguise have grown too great to bear. Whatever its past political advantages, the payroll tax now imposes an unnecessary burden on a stagnating economy. In an era of mass unemployment, mediocre wage growth and weak mobility from the bottom of the income ladder, it makes no sense to finance our retirement system with a tax that falls directly on wages and hiring and imposes particular burdens on small business and the working class. What\u2019s more, the payroll tax as it exists today can\u2019t cover the program\u2019s projected liabilities anyway, and the pay-as-you-go myth stands in the way of the changes required to keep Social Security solvent. All of the components of a sensible Social Security reform \u2014 means-testing for wealthier beneficiaries, changing the way benefits adjust for inflation, a slow increase in the retirement age \u2014 become easier if the program is treated as normal safety-net spending rather than an untouchable entitlement with a dedicated funding stream. By cutting the tax rate and promising to make up the difference out of general revenue, the payroll tax holiday took a big step in this direction \u2014 and letting it expire would take a big step back. Republicans have every reason to recognize this reality: their long-term size-of-government goals require Social Security reform, and the illusions fostered by the payroll tax are an obstacle \u2014 originally created by their political enemies! \u2014 to any restraint in what the program spends. Instead, a mix of ideology and cynicism has tilted Republicans against the payroll tax cut. The party\u2019s ideologues regard the issue as a distraction from the more important debate over income taxes, and some of them fret, \u00e0 la Mitt Romney with the \u201c47 percent,\u201d about taking too many Americans off the tax rolls. The party\u2019s cynics, meanwhile, have seized on the opportunity to imitate liberal scare campaigns on Social Security, and posture as staunch defenders of the retirement status quo. It\u2019s been left to a few prominent Democrats, including Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, to make the case for letting the holiday continue. This is a positive sign for liberalism, since it suggests a preference for middle-class paychecks over middle-class entitlements, and a willingness to recognize that the ideals of work and thrift and upward mobility aren\u2019t necessarily well served by the way we tax and spend today. It will be a discouraging sign for conservatism if these Democrats don\u2019t find Republican allies. Nothing cost the Republican Party more dearly in the last election than the sense that the party didn\u2019t care about the struggles of the middle class. The payroll tax cut is addressed directly to those struggles \u2014 and it\u2019s also a case where the short-term interests of Americans living paycheck to paycheck align with the long-term conservative interest in entitlement reform. That combination doesn\u2019t often come around. So there is only one question conservatives should be asking about the payroll tax holiday: How do we make it permanent?

My father left when I was 2 and my mother was pregnant. We moved to a town with no running water. When I was 7, we\u2019d get up at 5 a.m. and walk to a farm where the farmhands would give us free milk from their cows.One day, I complained about being poor, and my mother asked me what I was going to do about it. I said I was going to be a bullfighter, and she laughed and challenged me to fight a cow in a nearby field. I climbed the fence, and saw that there was also a bull. When the bull lowered its horns as if to charge, I ran back. It awoke something in me. I liked feeling that fear. In the late 1950s, my mother\u2019s sister in California sponsored her so she could move to the United States for a better life for us. My mother brought me to America when I was 15, and we worked to save money and send for my siblings. We took whatever jobs we could get. When I was 16, I enrolled in Santa Monica High School and, after graduating, attended Santa Monica College for a semester. But my family needed money, so I left and worked full time again. My passion for bullfighting was so strong that I found a man who trained Hollywood actors to perform stunts and took lessons from him. I\u2019d take the bus to meet him every Saturday, and he never even had me pay for the lessons. He taught me how to handle the cape, how to predict a bull\u2019s actions, and how to pose and look professional. When I returned to Costa Rica to look for bullfighting jobs, I visited a restaurant that had a bullring. I started fighting bulls and calves there every Sunday and soon got paid bookings. I had no phone, so I\u2019d look in the newspaper to find out where I\u2019d be appearing. Then I traveled to Mexico, called a few bullfighters and asked for their help. All but one laughed at me, but thanks to that one man\u2019s advice I found jobs in Mexico City. I became even more popular than in Costa Rica, and even appeared on \u201cThe Steve Allen Show\u201d in the United States. I started living the high life. I grew a bit careless in the ring and started getting injured, so I returned to the United States and found a job as a T.W.A. flight attendant. I enjoyed car racing so much that in the early years I\u2019d book flights to Spain or Italy on my free weekends just to watch a race. By the time I retired in 1987, I had risen to in-flight service manager. I met my future husband, Thomas J. Feeney, on a flight and eventually joined him in his La Jolla, Calif., investment company, Marathon Asset Management. I felt that the trust market was underserved and that it presented a good opportunity, so I left and opened Mission Management and Trust in 1994. We merged the companies this year, and Tom is now our chief investment officer. We specialize in investment management, trust administration and securities custody. I like to say we\u2019re a boutique company that caters to people who are conservative about their investments. Books and experience have taught me what I didn\u2019t learn in school. For example, I learned about self-discipline in business from \u201cWhy Should White Guys Have All the Fun?,\u201d about the career of Reginald Lewis, who was C.E.O. of the food company Beatrice International. He had plans and made them happen. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve done the same. After achieving the success I\u2019ve had, I\u2019m passionate about helping others needing jobs, or sending the elevator back down\u00a0so others have an increased chance at success. I arrived in this country with only a suitcase. In 2004, I was an Arizona delegate to the Republican National Convention and led the Pledge of Allegiance. I still close my eyes and relive that moment. As told to Patricia R.

Randy Polumbo, an artist and friend, had persuaded Mr. Rechnitz to tour the Gowanus space, known by locals as the Batcave, thinking that it would be a good home for Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s growing art collection and for artists\u2019 studios. A representative of the owner and a real estate broker had come along, Mr. Polumbo recalled in a recent interview. Mr. Rechnitz asked how many studio spaces could be created in the building if his art were not shown there, Mr. Polumbo said. Perhaps 50 or 60, he remembered saying. \u201cWhen I said this, his eyes lit up, and he said, \u2018That is what we will do,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Polumbo said. \u201cWithin a week of that visit, we were in negotiation to buy it.\u201d No formal announcement was made after Mr. Rechnitz bought the Batcave for what, according to property records, was $7 million. The move appeared to surprise even those working closely with him. \u201cHe wants to develop a space for artists to create and display art,\u201d Maureen Connelly, a former press secretary for Mayor Edward I. Koch who has been Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s spokeswoman on the velodrome project, said shortly after the purchase. \u201cThat\u2019s all I know about that project.\u201d Shy by nature, Mr. Rechnitz, 47, has avoided public attention for his projects \u2014 that is, as much as possible for someone making what at the time amounted to the largest single donation ever made to city parks. (It has since been surpassed by a $100 million gift given to Central Park by John A. Paulson.) He has never appeared in public to discuss the plan and has declined all requests for interviews, including for this article, referring all questions to Ms. Connelly. \u201cHe\u2019s been locked up in a box,\u201d said Michael Green, who knew Mr. Rechnitz from his days as an amateur bicycle racer in Central Park. That strategy has not always worked in his favor. News media outlets looking for a photograph of Mr. Rechnitz after the announcement resorted to one of the only pictures they could find: an image of Mr. Rechnitz, hair sticking out from under a knitted cap, taken from a 2009 video interview. Mr. Rechnitz had tried to get the video taken down before and after the announcement, said Suzannah B. Troy, 50, an artist who shot the clip and posted it on YouTube. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you would please take that video down,\u201d he wrote to her in July in an e-mail, which she provided to The New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty unflattering shot the media grabbed from the video.\u201d She refused. \u201cIt\u2019s authentic; you look like a Williamsburg hipster,\u201d she remembered telling him. (Ms. Connelly later released a more buttoned-up studio portrait.) The field-house plan has drawn criticism from some neighborhood groups in Brooklyn Heights who believe their quiet streets would be overrun with traffic from the proposed sports complex, which would include a 200-meter wooden cycling track and space for thousands to attend competitions with little space for parking. Others have questioned the need for such a project for an obscure sport. \u201cIt\u2019s just so self-evident that this is his personal passion,\u201d said Peter Flemming, co-chairman of the Brooklyn Bridge Park Community Council and one of the most outspoken critics of the plan. \u201cThe track-cycling community is devout, I\u2019m sure. The snowboard community is devout, too. There\u2019s no sport that doesn\u2019t have its devotees.\u201d Mr. Flemming added, \u201cHe\u2019s paying for his building, and then the city gets stuck with it.\u201d But friends of Mr. Rechnitz said he was serious about trying to create a site the community could use, while also building a track. \u201cJosh has got a big heart,\u201d said Matthew Heitmann, who was a partner with Mr. Rechnitz in an earlier version of the velodrome plan. \u201cI think he wants to do a lot of good.\u201d Mr. Rechnitz was born on June 2, 1965, in Red Bank, N.J., into a fortune amassed by his grandfather, Robert H. Heilbrunn, who invested in undervalued companies beginning during the Depression. Mr. Heilbrunn and his wife, Harriet, gave millions over the years to New York City institutions, including Columbia and Rockefeller Universities, the American Heart Association, Jewish groups and museums. Visitors to the American Museum of Natural History can walk along the 360-foot-long Harriet and Robert Heilbrunn Cosmic Pathway, spiraling down from the exit of the Hayden theater and through the 13-billion-year history of the universe. A family gift created a similar timeline of art history for the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Web site."},{"url":"http:\/\/travel.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/25\/travel\/a-food-bloggers-tour-of-kuala-lumpur.html","body":"CHOOSING where and what to eat in Malaysia\u2019s food-obsessed capital of Kuala Lumpur is no small feat. From the moment you enter this hot, humid, traffic-choked capital, known locally as K.L., endless culinary options influenced by numerous cuisines beckon, from wok-fried noodles topped with fresh seafood to steaming piles of naan and vats of fragrant curries. So how best to navigate this complex world of food? I turned to the local blogosphere for advice and personal guidance. These passionate food bloggers spend their weekends tirelessly hunting down the city\u2019s hidden treats, reporting on their gastronomic adventures to a devoted readership that\u2019s just as infatuated with local cuisine as they are. And as the city welcomes a dizzying number of eye-catching high-end restaurants, it\u2019s the bloggers who ensure that Kuala Lumpur\u2019s age-old culinary gems \u2014 and some of its most memorable meals \u2014 won\u2019t be forgotten.On a sultry weekend morning earlier this year, I joined a group of local customers \u2014 women in colorful headscarves, men in short-sleeved, button-down shirts and slacks \u2014 in partaking of a Malaysian ritual: a plate of nasi lemak at R. A. Nasi Lemak (15A Jalan Raja Abdullah; 60-12-354-6800), an outdoor restaurant along a busy road in central Kuala Lumpur, where nasi lemak is about 6 ringgit, or $2 at 3 ringgit to the dollar. Nasi lemak, the unofficial national dish, translates from the Malay as \u201cfatty rice,\u201d and it quickly became apparent why. As a server scooped a hearty helping of coconut-infused white rice from a wooden barrel onto a plate lined with a banana leaf, Lee Khang Yi, one of my blogger-guides, looked on approvingly. \u201cThis is nice rice,\u201d she said, before selecting from a dozen or so side dishes, which ranged from glistening hunks of fried chicken to paru goreng, deep-fried beef lungs coated in ginger, shallots and shredded lemon grass. Before grabbing a plastic stool at one of the stall\u2019s metal tables, Ms. Yi topped her plate with roasted peanuts, ikan bilis (small fried anchovies), a fried egg and sliced cucumbers \u2014 all essential accompaniments to nasi lemak. The bespectacled Ms. Yi, 40, is the authoritative voice behind the popular food blog Masak-Masak (masak-masak.blogspot.com) \u2014 literally \u201ccooking-cooking\u201d in Malay \u2014 a site she began seven years ago while between jobs. Her site became so popular that Ms. Yi abandoned a career in finance and is now a food editor for a major national newspaper, The Malay Mail. Drawing from the country\u2019s Malay, Chinese and Indian populations, versions of nasi lemak are as varied as the national population. \u201cAs the years have gone by, there is a racial division when it comes to food,\u201d Ms. Yi said. \u201cPeople will eat within their group. But nasi lemak has transcended all the races. Somehow or another everyone eats nasi lemak and finds something they like about it.\u201d She was quick to point out, though, that all iterations of the dish share a foundation. \u201cIt all starts with the rice, which has to be fluffy, nicely balanced and not too sweet,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m quite biased when it comes to nasi lemak.\u201d My next blogging companion, Jonathan Ooi, 32, brought me to Yut Kee restaurant (35 Jalan Dang Wangi; 60-3-2698-8108), where he has been going since childhood. \u201cThis was my grandfather\u2019s favorite coffee shop,\u201d he said as we crammed into a table between families with small children, elderly men reading local newspapers and servers shouting orders. \u201cHe used to come here for his daily breakfast when he worked at the nearby HSBC bank,\u201d he continued. \u201cSince he passed away, my parents, aunts and uncles and I have continued his tradition.\u201d Mr. Ooi, who works as a store designer, clearly inherited his grandfather\u2019s passion for food: he now runs the blog A Lil\u2019 Fat Monkey (alilfatmonkey.com), which chronicles Mr. Ooi\u2019s food and travel adventures around the world, covering both trendy new openings and old-school neighborhood favorites like Yut Kee, where the Lee family has been wooing patrons with Hainanese delicacies since 1928 \u2014 though at least one of the draws for Mr. Ooi is a ubiquitous one. \u201cThere is just something about the coffee here,\u201d Mr. Ooi said, sipping a cup of freshly brewed kopi-O (1.50 ringgit), coal-black coffee served with sugar. \u201cYou can taste the traditional roasting. The robusta beans are roasted with sugar and margarine.\u201d In the Chinese-Malaysian tradition, the glimmering, potent brew is served with thick slices of Hainanese bread (2.40 ringgit), either steamed into a pillowy texture or toasted on charcoal. \u201cThe bread should be full of holes, which gives it a nice crisp,\u201d Mr. Ooi said. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9803E4DB113AF936A15752C1A9649D8B63","body":"CHAMBI--Bahia Mehmet Bin.

They had been trying for decades to secure financing for a medical school in the Rio Grande Valley, only to watch a wealthier area to the north seal a deal first.Francisco Cigarroa, the chancellor of the University of Texas System, does not share those sentiments. With the wheels greased in Austin, Dr. Cigarroa said, he is even more confident that the Valley will get its medical school. \u201cThis only gives me more resolve to get the South Texas school of medicine accomplished,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve set the pathway for Austin. I\u2019m not giving myself an \u2018A\u2019 on my report card unless I get this done.\u201d But his commitment is just one piece of the South Texas puzzle. And what has worked in Austin \u2014\u00a0substantial public-private investment, financing set aside by the State Constitution for flagship institutions, and a voter-approved 5-cent property tax increase \u2014 is not necessarily a fit in the Rio Grande Valley. South Texas leaders must persuade hospitals to finance 120 residency slots, get local voters in the impoverished region to sign off on a taxing district, and \u2014\u00a0the toughest but most critical selling point \u2014\u00a0ask the cash-strapped Texas Legislature to provide $20 million a year. \u201cIf you were going to pick a time in the history of the Texas budget to create a new medical school, this is probably not the time you would pick to do it,\u201d said R. K. Whittington, the president of the South Texas Medical Foundation. But with local support for the medical school growing and the economy improving, Mr. Whittington said, \u201cI\u2019m more confident now than I was a year ago.\u201d The need is unquestionably there: studies show the fast-growing Valley, where the population is approaching 1.5 million, has 110 doctors per 100,000 people \u2014\u00a0half the national rate and well below the state average. And the existing physicians are aging; at Doctors Hospital at Renaissance in Edinburg, which, along with other regional hospitals, would be a hub for medical residents under the South Texas plan, 38 percent of physicians will approach retirement in the next 5 to 10 years. \u201cWe have many young people that forgo their plans, their dreams of becoming physicians, because it\u2019s a major sacrifice to leave the area,\u201d said Dr. Leonel Vela, the South Texas regional dean for the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. Roughly 80 percent of all Texas medical school graduates stay and practice in the communities where they perform their residencies, but U.T. has just 33 medical residency slots in the Valley. The University of Texas has long pledged to establish a medical school in South Texas, but residents there remain skeptical. The first bill to establish a South Texas medical school was introduced in the 1940s, Mr. Whittington said. And serious negotiations \u2014\u00a0spurred by a severe shortage of physicians in the region, and an underserved population plagued by epidemics \u2014\u00a0date back more than 20 years. \u201cWe\u2019re the part of the state everyone ignores \u2014\u00a0we basically get whatever\u2019s left over,\u201d said Alonzo Cantu, a Rio Grande Valley developer and the founder of Doctors Hospital at Renaissance. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of frustration, a lot of, \u2018Why them and not us?\u2019\u00a0\u201d In the last decade, the U.T. system has made progress in South Texas; it established regional academic health centers in Harlingen and Edinburg \u2014\u00a0precursors to a stand-alone medical school \u2014 invested nearly $110 million in medical education infrastructure, and has provided clinical rotations for more than 1,000 medical students affiliated with the Health Science Center in San Antonio, though the majority of them must leave the Valley to complete their residencies. State dollars and university system money are considered crucial to the plan in South Texas, where there are fewer options for creative financing and a relatively weak tax base. In 2009, lawmakers passed legislation authorizing the establishment of a South Texas medical school, but did not attach any financing to it. Then last spring the U.T. System Board of Regents approved spending $30 million a year \u2014\u00a0special financing set aside for flagship institutions \u2014\u00a0to help establish an Austin medical school. At the same meeting, regents reaffirmed their commitment to turn the South Texas regional health centers into a free-standing medical school, but without additional spending. For some South Texas leaders, the side-by-side resolutions amounted to a kick in the teeth. \u201cFor a long time we felt we were first in line for the next medical school,\u201d said Senator Juan Hinojosa, Democrat of McAllen. \u201cBut the Board of Regents was bending over backward to create a new medical school in Austin, and we felt like the bride left at the altar.\u201d By mid-August, some frustrated leaders and hospital executives were in College Station, discussing a possible South Texas medical school with John Sharp, the chancellor of the Texas A&M University System. Days after those conversations began, Dr. Cigarroa was in Edinburg, laying out a formal blueprint to graduate the first class of South Texas medical students by 2018. (The University of Texas at Austin, the Texas A&M University System and Doctors Hospital at Renaissance are corporate sponsors of The Texas Tribune.) Local leaders say that since then, the U.T. plan has gained momentum. \u201cI think they recognize that this is probably the train that is leaving the station,\u201d Mr. Whittington said. And though Mr. Sharp declined to say whether conversations about an A&M medical school in South Texas were proceeding, he said A&M officials want to be sure that the region is \u201cgiven the respect and service to its citizens that its people deserve.\u201d Added Mr. Cantu: \u201cIf a medical school is built down here, I think John Sharp had a lot to do with it.\u201d Dr. Cigarroa said the South Texas medical school plan never took a back seat to the Austin plan, citing the U.T. System\u2019s decade of financial investment in the region as evidence. It would be a mistake for the Valley to start splitting its medical school allegiances, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s critically important that we\u2019re all in,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we start dividing and diluting South Texas into various university systems, I\u2019m not sure the Valley would get the full benefit.\u201d He and other university leaders stress that there is no one-size-fits-all financing formula for medical schools. While a taxing district is always a tough sell, Dr. Cigarroa said, if South Texans see progress \u2014\u00a0like local hospitals expanding residency programs and more medical students treating patients in the Valley \u2014 they will be more likely to support one. He is also confident that lawmakers will come through with financing. Both Gov. Rick Perry and House Speaker Joe Straus have endorsed the concept of expanded access to medical education in South Texas, though they would not speak to specific budget appropriations. But Mr. Hinojosa, the vice chairman of the Senate\u2019s budget-writing committee, is not convinced. \u201cTo commit to $20 million a year under these economic circumstances,\u201d he said, \u201cand with the makeup of the Texas Legislature at this point, is not very realistic.\u201d eramshaw@texastribune.org"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/24\/business\/global\/cyprus-bailout-seen-as-near-but-not-yet-done-deal.html","body":"European officials on Friday continued to negotiate the release of emergency aid for Greece and a rescue for Cyprus but reached no conclusive deals despite claims of a breakthrough by the Cypriot government.Seeking to stave off financial collapse, Cyprus said Friday that it had negotiated a multibillion-euro bailout with international lenders, only to have the claim contradicted later by a formal statement from those creditors. The European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, collectively known as the troika, said there had been \u201cgood progress toward agreement on key policies to strengthen public finances, restore the health of the financial system, and strengthen competitiveness.\u201d It added that \u201cpreliminary results of a bank due-diligence exercise, expected in the next few weeks, will inform discussions between official lenders and Cyprus\u201d on the details of a bailout. Those comments suggest that Cyprus has agreed to the austerity measures that will accompany the loans. But a lack of clarity over how much capital the country\u2019s stricken banks may need is holding up a final agreement. Cyprus is expected to receive about 16 billion to 17 billion euros ($20.6 billion to $22 billion), a small amount by comparison with other European rescues but a sum roughly equal to the country\u2019s annual gross domestic product. Talks are continuing on how to unlock a 31.5 billion euro installment of loans for Greece from its international bailout program, money it needs to stave off bankruptcy. Euro zone finance ministers, who failed to reach a deal earlier this week, will resume discussions Monday. The deterioration of Greece\u2019s finances in the midst of a recession has made the deal elusive; the economic slowdown is preventing the country from hitting its financial targets. Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, said Friday that a compromise was near in which the I.M.F. would agree that Greece\u2019s debt could fall to 124 percent of G.D.P. by 2020 as opposed to a previous target of 120 percent. Euro zone finance ministers have already agreed on measures that would reduce Greece\u2019s debt to 130 percent of G.D.P. by 2020, Mr. Stournaras said. He said that a further 10 billion euros of savings would need to be found to bring debt down to the level desired by the I.M.F. by 2020. The austerity measures Greece has undertaken in exchange for its bailouts have pushed Cyprus to seek alternative forms of financial assistance from outside the European Union, including from Russia. Before the lenders issued their statement Friday contradicting Cyprus, Cypriot officials said that a deadline set by the European Central Bank to recapitalize the country\u2019s banks had forced them to agree to a bailout. \u201cThe bailout deal includes unpleasant measures,\u201d the government spokesman, Stefanos Stefanou, said without elaborating. The conditions of the bailout have caused friction between government officials and international lenders in recent weeks, though financial markets have been relatively relaxed about the negotiations. \u201cIn other circumstances this issue might have garnered more attention from markets, but it has been swamped by events elsewhere, including in Spain and Greece in particular,\u201d said Kenneth Wattret, co-head of European economics in London for BNP Paribas. Mr. Wattret said that one reason for the lack of market reaction was that Cyprus seemed to be heading toward an agreement. A failure by politicians to reach a deal would have worried investors more than a bailout, he said, as it would have called into question the effectiveness of Europe\u2019s crisis response. \u201cStill, once a deal has been struck, one potential source of event risk is removed,\u201d he added. Fitch Ratings said Friday that it was cutting its credit ratings on three of the island\u2019s banks \u2014 Bank of Cyprus, Cyprus Popular Bank and Hellenic Bank \u2014 which together have assets of 77.2 billion euros, equal to about 430 percent of G.D.P. The ratings agency said it thought that the failure of Bank of Cyprus and Cyprus Popular Bank was \u201cimminent\u201d and that the two would require \u201csizable\u201d injections of capital. The agency pointed out that the precedents set in other euro zone bailouts meant that the investments of senior bank creditors were likely to be protected. On Wednesday, Fitch downgraded Cyprus\u2019s rating for its long-term sovereign debt to BB- from BB+, adding that the outlook was negative. If Cyprus does reach a bailout agreement, it will follow in the footsteps of Greece, Ireland and Portugal, all of which had to be rescued by Europe and the International Monetary Fund. In addition, Spain has been offered up to 100 billion euros in aid for its crippled banking sector and may seek more help. The economic crisis in Greece has spilled over to Cyprus. Cyprus\u2019s economy, particularly its banking sector, is heavily exposed to Greece and Greek institutions.

The Swiss government is trying to repair relations with its European neighbors and the United States, which have been pressing it to lift its vaunted bank secrecy. The German opposition lawmakers argued that the proposed law was too lenient on tax dodgers and would not fully restore the revenue Germany was losing. They may also have been unwilling to hand Chancellor Angela Merkel a victory on the issue before elections next year. Social Democrats and Green Party members of the upper house of the German Parliament, the Bundesrat, voted largely along party lines to block adoption of the proposed tax agreement. The measure had already passed by a wide margin in the Bundestag, the lower house, where Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats and their partners hold a majority. \u201cIf the deal had passed, tax dodgers and their accomplices would have let out a sigh of relief,\u201d Norbert Walter-Borjans, a Socialist member of the Bundesrat and finance minister for the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, said in a statement. \u201cNow it\u2019s the honest taxpayers that can exhale.\u201d Mr. Walter-Borjans\u2019s state has on several occasions resorted to buying Swiss account data from whistle-blowers to pursue German tax dodgers. The deal, to which Switzerland had already agreed, would have gone into effect Jan. 1. It called for Swiss banks to make an upfront payment to the German Treasury of two billion Swiss francs, or $2.1 billion. The banks would ultimately have been reimbursed from Germans\u2019 undeclared accounts in a one-time payment of up to 41 percent of the accounts\u2019 value. The clients would thereafter have paid their taxes anonymously, at German income tax rates. German officials would have had access to additional data, but with client names still hidden behind the curtain of Swiss secrecy, Germany\u2019s federal and state governments would have been dependent on the good faith of Swiss banks to collect taxes on their behalf. The future of the deal, nearly two years in the making, is uncertain. Swiss officials fear that the issue could be lost in German politics until after the election, in the second half of 2013. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, will propose that a reconciliation committee of the upper and lower houses of Parliament discuss ways to salvage the agreement, said Silke Bruns, a ministry spokeswoman. She cautioned, though, that there was no guarantee that Parliament would agree to Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s plan. \u201cWe\u2019re convinced the Swiss deal is a good solution,\u201d Ms. Bruns said, \u201cand that\u2019s why we\u2019re pushing for it.\u201d While the parliamentary defeat may have been an embarrassment to Ms. Merkel, it was a significant setback for Switzerland\u2019s banks, which have been laboring under a deep cloud of uncertainty since 2008. A tax deal with France that had seemed locked up is being reopened at the request of the French. Relations with Washington remain the biggest source of Swiss concern, after the Justice Department indicted 11 Swiss financial institutions on suspicion of helping Americans evade taxes. United States officials have so far shown little interest in negotiating anything short of the surrender of all information on the banks\u2019 American clients. Some German opponents of the proposed Swiss agreement have called on Berlin to take a similar hard-line approach. The Swiss Bankers Association expressed its \u201cregret\u201d at the Bundesrat\u2019s decision, but said, \u201cWe consider it positive, however, that the upper house has rejected the tax agreement for reasons of purely domestic policy and not for objective reasons.\u201d Mario Tuor, a Swiss government spokesman, noted that without a deal, the status quo would remain: German officials can seek specific information from the Swiss government on people suspected of tax evasion, or go back to buying data stolen from Swiss banks. \u201cWith an agreement, every German taxpayer in Switzerland would be taxed,\u201d Mr. Tuor said. The Swiss government \u201cremains prepared to bring the ratification process with Germany to a successful conclusion,\u201d Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, the Swiss president and finance minister, said in a statement. \u201cThere are no obstacles to ratification on the Swiss side.\u201d Chris Cottrell contributed reporting from Berlin."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/24\/business\/global\/cyprus-bailout-seen-as-near-but-not-yet-a-done-deal.html","body":"European officials on Friday continued to negotiate the release of emergency aid for Greece and a rescue for Cyprus but reached no conclusive deals despite claims of a breakthrough by the Cypriot government.Seeking to stave off financial collapse, Cyprus said Friday that it had negotiated a multibillion-euro bailout with international lenders, only to have the claim contradicted later by a formal statement from those creditors.

A failure by politicians to reach a deal would have worried investors more than a bailout, he said, as it would have called into question the effectiveness of Europe\u2019s crisis response. \u201cStill, once a deal has been struck, one potential source of event risk is removed,\u201d he added. Fitch Ratings said Friday that it was cutting its credit ratings on three of the island\u2019s banks \u2014 Bank of Cyprus, Cyprus Popular Bank and Hellenic Bank \u2014 which together have assets of 77.2 billion euros, equal to about 430 percent of G.D.P. The ratings agency said it thought that the failure of Bank of Cyprus and Cyprus Popular Bank was \u201cimminent\u201d and that the two would require \u201csizable\u201d injections of capital. The agency pointed out that the precedents set in other euro zone bailouts meant that the investments of senior bank creditors were likely to be protected. On Wednesday, Fitch downgraded Cyprus\u2019s rating for its long-term sovereign debt to BB- from BB+, adding that the outlook was negative. If Cyprus does reach a bailout agreement, it will follow in the footsteps of Greece, Ireland and Portugal, all of which had to be rescued by Europe and the International Monetary Fund. In addition, Spain has been offered up to 100 billion euros in aid for its crippled banking sector and may seek more help. The economic crisis in Greece has spilled over to Cyprus. Cyprus\u2019s economy, particularly its banking sector, is heavily exposed to Greece and Greek institutions.

The Swiss government is trying to repair relations with its European neighbors and the United States, which have been pressing it to lift its vaunted bank secrecy. The German opposition lawmakers argued that the proposed law was too lenient on tax dodgers and would not fully restore the revenue Germany was losing. They may also have been unwilling to hand Chancellor Angela Merkel a victory on the issue before elections next year. Social Democrats and Green Party members of the upper house of the German Parliament, the Bundesrat, voted largely along party lines to block adoption of the proposed tax agreement. The measure had already passed by a wide margin in the Bundestag, the lower house, where Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats and their partners hold a majority. \u201cIf the deal had passed, tax dodgers and their accomplices would have let out a sigh of relief,\u201d Norbert Walter-Borjans, a Socialist member of the Bundesrat and finance minister for the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, said in a statement. \u201cNow it\u2019s the honest taxpayers that can exhale.\u201d Mr. Walter-Borjans\u2019s state has on several occasions resorted to buying Swiss account data from whistle-blowers to pursue German tax dodgers. The deal, to which Switzerland had already agreed, would have gone into effect Jan. 1. It called for Swiss banks to make an upfront payment to the German Treasury of two billion Swiss francs, or $2.1 billion. The banks would ultimately have been reimbursed from Germans\u2019 undeclared accounts in a one-time payment of up to 41 percent of the accounts\u2019 value. The clients would thereafter have paid their taxes anonymously, at German income tax rates. German officials would have had access to additional data, but with client names still hidden behind the curtain of Swiss secrecy, Germany\u2019s federal and state governments would have been dependent on the good faith of Swiss banks to collect taxes on their behalf. The future of the deal, nearly two years in the making, is uncertain. Swiss officials fear that the issue could be lost in German politics until after the election, in the second half of 2013. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, will propose that a reconciliation committee of the upper and lower houses of Parliament discuss ways to salvage the agreement, said Silke Bruns, a ministry spokeswoman. She cautioned, though, that there was no guarantee that Parliament would agree to Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s plan. \u201cWe\u2019re convinced the Swiss deal is a good solution,\u201d Ms. Bruns said, \u201cand that\u2019s why we\u2019re pushing for it.\u201d While the parliamentary defeat may have been an embarrassment to Ms. Merkel, it was a significant setback for Switzerland\u2019s banks, which have been laboring under a deep cloud of uncertainty since 2008. A tax deal with France that had seemed locked up is being reopened at the request of the French. Relations with Washington remain the biggest source of Swiss concern, after the Justice Department indicted 11 Swiss financial institutions on suspicion of helping Americans evade taxes. United States officials have so far shown little interest in negotiating anything short of the surrender of all information on the banks\u2019 American clients. Some German opponents of the proposed Swiss agreement have called on Berlin to take a similar hard-line approach. The Swiss Bankers Association expressed its \u201cregret\u201d at the Bundesrat\u2019s decision, but said, \u201cWe consider it positive, however, that the upper house has rejected the tax agreement for reasons of purely domestic policy and not for objective reasons.\u201d Mario Tuor, a Swiss government spokesman, noted that without a deal, the status quo would remain: German officials can seek specific information from the Swiss government on people suspected of tax evasion, or go back to buying data stolen from Swiss banks. \u201cWith an agreement, every German taxpayer in Switzerland would be taxed,\u201d Mr. Tuor said. The Swiss government \u201cremains prepared to bring the ratification process with Germany to a successful conclusion,\u201d Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, the Swiss president and finance minister, said in a statement. \u201cThere are no obstacles to ratification on the Swiss side.\u201d Chris Cottrell contributed reporting from Berlin."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/24\/world\/europe\/european-union-budget-talks-collapse.html","body":"BRUSSELS \u2014 A summit meeting of European leaders collapsed Friday amid bitter discord over a new budget for the European Union, delivering a further blow to a 27-nation grouping already struggling to contain a debt crisis, social discontent fueled by rising unemployment, and doubts about the long-term viability of the euro currency.Leaders abandoned efforts to set the shape of a trillion-euro long-term budget and called for a new round of talks early next year to try to reach a deal. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who along with the leaders of the Netherlands, Sweden and several other countries had pushed hard for deep cuts, criticized proposals that left spending on the union\u2019s administrative machinery intact. This, he said at a news conference, showed that \u201cBrussels continues to exist as if in a parallel universe,\u201d referring to the headquarters for the European Union, which employs about 33,000 people in the European Commission, the union\u2019s main administrative arm. Mr. Cameron complained that \u201cmore than 200 commission staff earn more than I do.\u201d The refusal to trim bureaucratic costs, which amount to about 6 percent of total spending, is \u201cinsulting to European taxpayers\u201d as many governments are slashing spending, Mr. Cameron said. The European Commission had no immediate comment on Mr. Cameron\u2019s remarks, but officials noted that the commission last year announced a number of civil service overhauls. These include plans to reduce the staff by 5 percent between 2013 and 2017 through \u201cnormal turnover,\u201d to raise the minimum working week to 40 hours from 37.5, and to increase the retirement age to 65 from 63. The impasse after two days of negotiations was the second failure this week in Brussels. Finance ministers met all night on Monday without reaching an agreement on whether to release the next round of emergency aid to Greece, where unemployment is around 25 percent. Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, which represents the leaders of European Union member states, convened the summit meeting and called off the negotiations rather than prolonging them through the weekend. He said that the European Union\u2019s budget \u201chas to be balanced and well prepared, not in the mood of improvisation, because we are touching upon jobs, we are touching upon sensitive issues.\u201d \u201cWe should be able to bridge existing divergences\u201d in the new year, Mr. Van Rompuy said. Much of the attention at the meeting focused on Mr. Cameron, who rallied a group of countries in favor of deep cuts to the Multiannual Financial Framework, a seven-year spending plan. Disagreements over where the ax should fall left France and Germany on different sides, disrupting a French-German tandem without which significant deals in Europe rarely happen. Germany pushed for cuts, though not as insistently as Britain. France defended payments to farmers, which make up around 40 percent of the current budget, but insisted that there was no rupture with Germany. \u201cI don\u2019t only defend the position of France, but the position of Europe as a whole,\u201d President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said. The negotiating marathon over the budget is held every seven years. The focus on hard cash tends to push national interests to the fore and swamp talk of European harmony, a cause for which the Norwegian Nobel Committee last month named the European Union as the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. The budget, which amounts to about $168 billion per year, goes mostly to subsidize farmers and support regional projects in poorer member states. These policies were originally intended to help bind Europe together and mute the economic discord that in the past fueled bloody wars. But differences in economic performance and in priorities between member states are huge, pushing them to embrace divergent agendas in budget talks. In large measure, this is because what began as an economic bloc comprising six similarly developed market economies in Western Europe is now a 27-member body that includes 10 much poorer Eastern and Central European nations that were part of the socialist bloc. As well as divisions between east and west, there is also a big gulf between northern countries, especially Germany, and so-called Club Med states in the south like Greece, which, burdened with huge debts, is struggling to keep its economy afloat and avoid social unrest. \u201cThere are still important differences on a number of key issues, especially the overall size of the budget and the fairness of distributions between member states,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, told reporters as the summit meeting broke up on Friday afternoon."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/24\/us\/politics\/obamas-2nd-inaugural-will-likely-draw-fewer-to-capital.html","body":"WASHINGTON \u2014 There\u2019s only one first time.With President Obama and Congressional Republicans sparring over the looming fiscal deadline, the Middle East in crisis and Washington still chattering about a sex scandal that brought down the nation\u2019s top spy, one word does not seem to be on anybody\u2019s lips here in the capital: inauguration. A second inaugural is typically less exciting than the first, but perhaps no president has had a harder act of his own to follow than Mr. Obama, whose star-studded 2009 swearing-in as the nation\u2019s first black president brought an estimated 1.8 million people to Washington. Bruce Springsteen and Bono rocked the National Mall the night before, Oprah Winfrey taped her show at the Kennedy Center, and who could forget Aretha Franklin singing \u201cMy Country, \u2019Tis of Thee\u201d in that fabulous bow-tie hat? \u201cYou can\u2019t recreate the magic that was four years ago \u2014 as a country we\u2019ve gone through way too much,\u201d said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist who spent two decades as a Capitol Hill aide. \u201cThe hopes and expectations were so high it was difficult for him to meet them,\u201d he said of Mr. Obama. \u201cHe\u2019s now just a mere mortal.\u201d But even a mere mortal gets to party after taking the presidential oath of office, and White House and Congressional officials are beginning to plan Washington\u2019s quadrennial inaugural festivities, even if there is not quite the same electricity in the air as four years ago. This time there will be a twist: the constitutionally mandated date for the presidential swearing-in, Jan. 20, falls on a Sunday in 2013, so Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. will administer the oath to Mr. Obama privately that day at the White House, while the public ceremony, parade, and other events will be pushed back to Monday. (Chief Justice Roberts also administered a private oath to Mr. Obama in 2009, after the two men flubbed the words during the public ceremony.) The switch \u2014 only the seventh time in the nation\u2019s history that the inauguration date has fallen on a Sunday \u2014 put Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat, in a tough spot, because Monday, Jan. 21, is also the federal holiday commemorating Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s birthday. As chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, Mr. Schumer is charged with overseeing preparations at the Capitol, and he began planning before the election. \u201cMy great worry was that had Obama lost, having him leave on M.L.K. Day wouldn\u2019t be so good,\u201d the senator said, referring to the tradition in which the departing president leaves Washington after the swearing-in of his (or, perhaps some day, her) successor. Mr. Schumer and his team are ahead of the White House in planning. At the Capitol, the inaugural platform where Mr. Obama will have his swearing-in do-over is already under construction. Mr. Schumer, capitalizing on the perks of his position, has announced that the New York-based Saratoga Springs Water Company will provide bottled water; the wine served at the inaugural luncheon will be a Finger Lakes riesling, and the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir will perform during the ceremony. While Congress is in charge of what happens on its turf \u2014 the ceremony and luncheon inside the Capitol\u2019s Statuary Hall \u2014 the White House is responsible for the parade, inaugural balls and other events. The inaugural will be the third major event in recent months that has forced Mr. Obama to confront the ghosts of four years ago. At the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, he accepted his nomination before a crowd of 84,000 in a packed outdoor stadium; this year in Charlotte, Democrats worried about whether Mr. Obama could fill a stadium, and his acceptance speech was eventually moved inside to an arena with seating for 20,200, because of bad weather, his campaign said. For this year\u2019s victory party, the Obama campaign invited 10,000 supporters to fill the floor of a Chicago convention center; the crowd was jubilant, but it was a far cry from the 200,000 people who gathered in Grant Park on election night 2008. Mr. Obama has yet to announce the members of his presidential inaugural committee (known here as the PIC), but people familiar with his plans say he will rely on longtime Democratic strategists including Steve Kerrigan, who ran the president\u2019s first inaugural and the Charlotte convention; Erik Smith, the creative director of the 2009 inaugural; Jim Margolis, who developed advertisements for the president\u2019s re-election campaign; and David Cusack, who orchestrated presidential trips as Mr. Obama\u2019s director of advance and later helped run the convention. As for Mr. Obama\u2019s speech, White House officials said there has so far been little discussion of it. Nor has there been much buzz in the city about the festivities. \u201cWow,\u201d said John Podesta, who ran Mr. Obama\u2019s transition team in 2008 and is ordinarily plugged into all things Democratic. \u201cThat is really not on my radar.\u201d By the end of November 2008, hotels were booked solid, not only in Washington but as far away as Pennsylvania and West Virginia. People were renting out their homes for tens of thousands of dollars. Even campsites were filling up. Yet this week, the Days Inn on Connecticut Avenue, a short Metro ride from downtown, still has rooms available, beginning at $430 a night (more than triple the regular rate) with a four-night minimum, customary for inaugural weeks. The historic Willard, which sits along the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route, also has rooms available, a spokeswoman said, including a few \u201cwell-appointed Oval Suites,\u201d for $5,700 a night, with a four-night minimum plus a $27,000 catering minimum \u2014 \u201cperfect for a parade viewing party.\u201d If history is any guide, anywhere from 300,000 to 600,000 people will turn out for Mr. Obama\u2019s swearing-in ceremony, hotels will sell out and the city will slip into its usual inaugural celebratory mood. In 2005, thousands of Texans descended on the capital for the second inauguration of President George W. Bush, just as they had in 2001. Mr. Bush raised a record $43 million for that affair, which included fireworks, a concert on the Mall and nine balls. Mr. Obama topped Mr. Bush\u2019s fund-raising record in 2009, taking in more than $53 million, Federal Election Commission records show. Taxpayers finance the swearing-in ceremony, luncheon and security, while private donations pay for everything else. Four years ago, Mr. Obama refused to accept donations from corporations, unions and lobbyists; he has not yet decided whether to do so this time. While Mr. Obama cannot possibly recreate 2009, when his approval ratings soared above 80 percent, old Washington hands, even Republicans, say the president should take the occasion to celebrate. He did, after all, win a bruising election, and a little pomp and circumstance might offer a nice break from the usual partisan bickering in Washington \u2014 something Mr. Obama promised, but has been unable, to overcome. \u201cIt is a celebration of American democracy, it is a renewal of our citizenship, it is a recognition that we have continuity in government and everybody comes together for that one day,\u201d said Kenneth M. Duberstein, who was White House chief of staff during President Ronald Reagan\u2019s second term. \u201cBut it\u2019s a little bit like a second marriage. It\u2019s not quite as exciting, the honeymoon is not as long and you realize on both sides that hope has been replaced by reality.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/24\/business\/economy\/oil-supply-is-rising-but-demand-keeps-pace-and-then-some.html","body":"IT used to be taken for granted that as economies grew, they would use more oil. That was a major reason cited in warnings that the world would run out of oil, particularly if standards of living rose in developing countries.Well, standards of living are improving in developing countries, but the dire forecasts now appear to be wrong. In part that is because new discoveries and improving technologies have increased the amount of oil that can be produced. It also reflects conservation, in part, as cars become more efficient and as other steps are taken to reduce oil use. The International Energy Agency, in its 2012 World Energy Outlook, released last week, forecast that American oil production, which began to rise in 2009 after decades of decline, would continue rising through at least 2020, when it could be about as high as it was in 1970, the year of peak production. At the same time it forecast that by 2035, American oil consumption, which peaked in 2005, could decline to levels not seen since the 1960s, depending on how much conservation is encouraged. The I.E.A. report also forecast that by around 2020, the United States could surpass Saudi Arabia as the world\u2019s largest oil producer, and that while the country was not likely to become a net exporter of oil, the North American continent as a whole could be by around 2030. But despite declining demand in some countries that historically were heavy users of oil, the world demand for oil seems likely to continue to rise. The I.E.A. forecast that global energy demand \u2014 including demand for energy produced by other sources \u2014 is likely to rise by 35 percent by 2035, with a large part of the increase coming from China and India. In 1969, the United States consumed a third of the oil used in the world, while China used less than 1 percent. Last year the United States\u2019 share was less than 22 percent, while the Chinese accounted for 11 percent. The I.E.A. forecasts that by 2030, the American share could be less than the Chinese one. By 2035, American consumption of oil is expected to be as much as one-third less than it was last year. In China, oil consumption is expected to be up as much as two-thirds from the 2011 level, and India\u2019s is predicted to more than double. The accompanying charts show trends in oil consumption in the United States, Japan, China and India, as well as in the other major economies \u2014 defined as the 32 countries other than Japan and the United States that are in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In each chart, the oil consumption in 2011 is shown as 100 percent, and the amount of oil used in that year is shown. For each area, two forecasts are shown. One is based on the assumption that current policies will continue. The other, labeled \u201cnew policies\u201d by the I.E.A., assumes that countries will gradually keep promises they have made to encourage conservation \u2014 promises that in the United States include increasing fuel economy in cars and trucks and at least a small increase in the use of natural gas to fuel trucks. The I.E.A. says that if those promises are kept, oil prices in real terms are likely to be only a little higher than they are now; if current policies continue, the price is likely to rise more rapidly.

For example, if two similar families have the same income, they should ordinarily pay roughly the same amount of income tax, regardless of the sources or uses of that income.\u201d\u2014 Tax Reform report of the Treasury Department to President Ronald Reagan, November 1984 As Washington grapples with the budget, it might be worth asking a simple question: What would Ronald Reagan do? He was the last president to preside over a significant tax reform, one that did exactly what both candidates in this year\u2019s presidential election said they want to do: lower tax rates and close loopholes. And a critical part of that reform was to end the historical system of taxing capital gains at lower rates than ordinary income. In the name of fairness, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 raised the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains to 28 percent from 20 percent at the same time it reduced the maximum rate on ordinary income to 28 percent from 50 percent. Doing that again in a tax reform act of 2013 would do more than raise revenue and increase fairness. It would bring an abrupt end to the \u201ccarried interest\u201d tax dodge, in which managers in the private equity business are able to define their compensation as capital gains and thus pay far lower income tax rates than do ordinary people with far less income. Ideally, there will be two tax reform efforts in the next 18 months. The first, going on now, is a simple patch-up, aimed at dealing with the pending increases in taxes brought on largely by the expiration of the Bush \u201ctemporary\u201d tax cuts. If the lame duck Congress and President Obama can avert disaster, raising some revenue while not devastating the economy, they will have succeeded. But the next move should be aimed at comprehensive tax reform. The Obama administration should look to President Reagan\u2019s second term for inspiration. The Reagan method included a comprehensive, well-thought-out proposal that dealt with the myriad details that can rise up to frustrate any efforts at change, put together painstakingly by the Treasury Department. Then there was a bipartisan effort to get it through Congress, with inevitable compromises but with clear goals in mind. The proper way to approach that proposal is to accept that the government needs to raise a certain amount of money. There can be differences over spending, obviously, but there should be consensus that whatever decisions are reached, the tax system adopted should be expected to finance those expenditures over an economic cycle, with deficits in difficult economic times and surpluses in good years. With an agreement that taxes should raise a certain amount of revenue \u2014 presumably expressed as a percentage of G.D.P. \u2014 then the debate on actual tax policies can take place in an atmosphere very different from the ones we have had in the past. Every tax deduction and every tax exemption should be viewed not just as giving a break to whatever deserving group has hired a good lobbyist but as forcing the rest of us to pay more. One way to do that would be to calculate a system, based on a simple progression of tax rates, without any deductions or exclusions, that would produce the needed revenue. Then the debate over each tax break would include a discussion of just how much the rates would have to rise if that break were granted for those who can take advantage of it. Do you want to preserve the deduction for interest on home mortgages, in the name of encouraging homeownership? Fine. Just understand that it would raise the marginal tax rate for every one of us by a certain number of percentage points. The same goes for charitable deductions, or not taxing certain fringe benefits like the cost of health insurance premiums. With that in mind, we come to the capital gains tax break. It is defended as critical to economic growth and prosperity, on the theory that without it money will not be invested. But the empirical data to back that up is lacking, to say the least. Over the last 30 years, the economy and the stock market has tended to do better when the capital gains rate was high. That does not prove causation, of course. But if the data went the other way you can be sure supporters of low capital gains rates would be citing it.

For example, if two similar families have the same income, they should ordinarily pay roughly the same amount of income tax, regardless of the sources or uses of that income.\u201d \u2014 Tax Reform report of the Treasury Department to President Ronald Reagan, November 1984 As Washington grapples with the budget, it might be worth asking a simple question: What would Ronald Reagan do? He was the last president to preside over a significant tax reform, one that did exactly what both candidates in this year\u2019s presidential election said they want to do: lower tax rates and close loopholes. And a critical part of that reform was to end the historical system of taxing capital gains at lower rates than ordinary income. In the name of fairness, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 raised the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains to 28 percent from 20 percent at the same time it reduced the maximum rate on ordinary income to 28 percent from 50 percent. Doing that again in a tax reform act of 2013 would do more than raise revenue and increase fairness. It would bring an abrupt end to the \u201ccarried interest\u201d tax dodge, in which managers in the private equity business are able to define their compensation as capital gains and thus pay far lower income tax rates than do ordinary people with far less income. Ideally, there will be two tax reform efforts in the next 18 months. The first, going on now, is a simple patch-up, aimed at dealing with the pending increases in taxes brought on largely by the expiration of the Bush \u201ctemporary\u201d tax cuts. If the lame duck Congress and President Obama can avert disaster, raising some revenue while not devastating the economy, they will have succeeded. But the next move should be aimed at comprehensive tax reform. The Obama administration should look to President Reagan\u2019s second term for inspiration. The Reagan method included a comprehensive, well-thought-out proposal that dealt with the myriad details that can rise up to frustrate any efforts at change, put together painstakingly by the Treasury Department. Then there was a bipartisan effort to get it through Congress, with inevitable compromises but with clear goals in mind. The proper way to approach that proposal is to accept that the government needs to raise a certain amount of money. There can be differences over spending, obviously, but there should be consensus that whatever decisions are reached, the tax system adopted should be expected to finance those expenditures over an economic cycle, with deficits in difficult economic times and surpluses in good years. With an agreement that taxes should raise a certain amount of revenue \u2014 presumably expressed as a percentage of G.D.P. \u2014 then the debate on actual tax policies can take place in an atmosphere very different from the ones we have had in the past. Every tax deduction and every tax exemption should be viewed not just as giving a break to whatever deserving group has hired a good lobbyist but as forcing the rest of us to pay more. One way to do that would be to calculate a system, based on a simple progression of tax rates, without any deductions or exclusions, that would produce the needed revenue. Then the debate over each tax break would include a discussion of just how much the rates would have to rise if that break were granted for those who can take advantage of it. Do you want to preserve the deduction for interest on home mortgages, in the name of encouraging homeownership? Fine. Just understand that it would raise the marginal tax rate for every one of us by a certain number of percentage points. The same goes for charitable deductions, or not taxing certain fringe benefits like the cost of health insurance premiums. With that in mind, we come to the capital gains tax break. It is defended as critical to economic growth and prosperity, on the theory that without it money will not be invested. But the empirical data to back that up is lacking, to say the least. Over the last 30 years, the economy and the stock market has tended to do better when the capital gains rate was high. That does not prove causation, of course. But if the data went the other way you can be sure supporters of low capital gains rates would be citing it. It also needs to be understood that the current system ends up discriminating against many who own stocks and mutual funds and thus receive capital gains and dividends. If your investments are in retirement plans, like 401(k) accounts, the profits are not taxed until the money is taken out. And then the money is taxed at ordinary income tax rates, regardless of whether it originated as capital gains. As a result, most of the money earned by the highest-income taxpayers comes from tax-advantaged dividends and capital gains. In most years, more than half the capital gains reported to the Internal Revenue Service are received by people with annual incomes of more than $1 million."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/23\/us\/in-texas-2014-campaigns-have-already-begun.html","body":"Just when your mailbox is clear of attacks and your television is free of fuzzy and unflattering black-and-white images of career politicians, the political pros have already started manufacturing grist for the elections two years from now.Comptroller Susan Combs, who would love to be the state\u2019s next lieutenant governor, just moved a top aide, David White, from her state office to her campaign. Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson just hired Chris Elam, a political operative, away from the Republican Party of Texas to run his campaign \u2014 an announcement made under the letterhead \u201cPatterson for Lieutenant Governor.\u201d Across Austin, especially in the blocks closest to the State Capitol, it\u2019s not hard to find bumper stickers promoting Todd Staples, the state\u2019s agriculture commissioner, for lieutenant governor. And here comes George P. Bush, the newest bearer of the family franchise, who has made the necessary filings for a campaign. Associates say he will consider running for one of those emptying statewide offices. But all that is really known is that he filed the paperwork to run for something. Could be anything from governor to a spot on a backwater appellate court. Don\u2019t forget the current occupant of that corner office on the second floor of the Capitol\u2019s east wing. Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst is not acting like a retiree. He lost an expensive United States Senate race in July, but he has jumped back into his work, naming Senate committee heads early and announcing his support for legislation, including a bill that would require welfare applicants to take drug tests. And he looks like a guy who wants to keep his job. It\u2019s 2012 to most of us, but it\u2019s 2014 to them. The speculation game is nothing new and is based partly on the state\u2019s recent history of electing Republicans in statewide elections, and partly on the fact that the hierarchy in statewide offices has been relatively static. Voters may not be ready to talk about it, but the state\u2019s aspiring political talents are eager to move up, more so than usual because they have not had open seats to grab. Now, maybe \u2014\u00a0maybe \u2014\u00a0they will. The game of musical chairs is already under way; Republicans started talking among themselves about presidential nominations before Mitt Romney had conceded. But in Texas, the music is still playing: someone in that pack of wannabes could back away from the lieutenant governor\u2019s seat and set his or her sights on something else \u2014 maybe even re-election or retirement. And the lines are forming for the contestants\u2019 current seats, which could force them to make decisions before they might normally do so. Mr. Patterson\u2019s run sets up a run by Mr. Bush (his father, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, told potential supporters in a fund-raising letter that his son had his eye on the land office). At least three Texans have expressed interest in the comptroller job, should Ms. Combs move on. They haven\u2019t hired yet. Heck, Gov. Rick Perry, whose job will be on the ballot in 2014, hasn\u2019t filled out the political staff he disbanded after his presidential run. Mr. Dewhurst\u2019s plans aren\u2019t clear. Neither are those of Attorney General Greg Abbott, who has quietly expressed interest in running for governor. To this point, he and Mr. Perry have been close allies; their lists of big donors are close to identical. No signs of a breakup there, but ambition can be a catalyst. Again, no motion there. The 2013 legislative session could clarify some of this, both in terms of the issues that rise and fall, and because Mr. Perry and Mr. Abbott \u2014\u00a0and after them, the others \u2014 have said they will make their plans public in June, when the session is over. Statewide officials can\u2019t raise money during a legislative session, or for the month that precedes one. June will come without any new sign of financial strength, because none of them will have done anything (the restriction doesn\u2019t apply to non-officeholders like Mr. Bush). The early moves to staff campaigns could help them raise money during the remaining weeks before the blackout, however. Their efforts on the campaign finance front will be reported to regulators in January, just as the session gets under way. Texans will get a good peek at some 2014 prospects in June, when Mr. Perry and Mr. Abbott and the others announce their intentions. But those are just announcements: \u00a0the campaigns are already working. rramsey@texastribune.org"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/23\/world\/europe\/berlin-tour-raises-awareness-on-lobbying.html","body":"BERLIN \u2014 The sold-out walking tour began along the Spree River here, within sight of the Reichstag\u2019s glass dome. But the group would not visit the historic Parliament building, Checkpoint Charlie or the Brandenburg Gate. About 30 people assembled instead to spend a gray Saturday afternoon in November standing outside office buildings in a cold drizzle.They were there to follow Timo Lange, 30, dressed all in black, with a hint of stubble on his chin, to learn how influence peddlers ply their trade in the German capital. Mr. Lange is a campaigner for the nonprofit group LobbyControl, which began giving the tours in 2009, to unexpected success for such a seemingly wonky subject. This year the group has given 144 tours for about 3,400 participants, who pay around $13 (half price for students). The tour\u2019s success reflects an electorate that, by American standards, has a low tolerance for money in politics. \u201cThe problem is the linkage between economic power and political power,\u201d said Daniela Haug, 49, a commercial producer and photographer who joined several friends for the crash course on how interest groups, businesses and trade associations try to affect policy. \u201cYou see things differently, and you can make decisions better yourself, when you experience it firsthand.\u201d In front of the unassuming dark brick building that is the home to offices of the German Brewers Federation, Mr. Lange explained how that group hosted parties and flattered politicians. He held up a photograph of a conservative Bavarian politician, Ilse Aigner, the group\u2019s \u201cambassador of German beer\u201d for 2009, as well as one of a prominent Social Democrat, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who was given the same designation in 2008. \u201cHim?\u201d an older woman asked with more than a hint of surprise, as she grasped the tour\u2019s first lesson: lobbying is not a game for any single party or for half of the political spectrum. Another example Mr. Lange offered: the leader of the cigarette lobby in Germany was, until last month, a former Green Party member of Parliament who does not smoke. Mr. Lange regaled the tour group with war stories. After a series of high-profile cases of alcohol poisoning among teenagers, the brewers teamed up with broadcasters and soccer teams to derail a drive for restrictions on the sale and advertising of beer. At the next stop, he gestured at a plaque for the German Chemical Industry Association as he detailed how the chemical industry worked overtime to soften new European regulations on its products. And then there was the Initiative for a New Social Market Economy, which paid for a soap opera to use scripts portraying unpopular labor market changes more favorably, Mr. Lange said. That backfired when the move became public. \u201cWe are very thin-skinned when it comes to any form of propaganda,\u201d Claas Lorenz, 25, a student on the tour, said in a succinct reference to Germany\u2019s Nazi history. \u201cWe had very bad experiences with it in our past.\u201d Andrea R\u00f6mmele, a professor at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin, said: \u201cMoney in campaigns in the United States is freedom of speech; it\u2019s seen as a way of expressing oneself. In Germany, giving money in politics is always seen as trying to buy access.\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s leading political challenger, former Finance Minister Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, suffered a significant setback last month when it was revealed that he had made about $1.6 million from speaking fees in three years. German attitudes toward politics and money help explain the enduring appeal of Ms. Merkel, who still lives in the apartment she got before she became chancellor, and who hikes on vacation. \u201cMerkel is so beloved for her sober, unglamorous style of governing,\u201d said Frank Decker, a professor of political science at the University of Bonn. \u201cWith her, you would never imagine that she might use politics to become rich.\u201d Germany is 10 months away from the parliamentary election that will determine whether Ms. Merkel wins a third term and her party, the Christian Democratic Union, maintains its grip on the Bundestag. Yet nothing awaits Germans like the multibillion-dollar orgy of political fund-raising and the mind-numbing barrage of television advertisements that tormented swing-state voters in the United States. The Christian Democrats spent a combined total of just $112 million during the 2009 election year, which included the races for all 598 seats in the federal Parliament and elections for six state Parliaments, as well as regional and municipal votes. German voters will have a few weeks of debates and campaign rallies. Lampposts will carry demure and even rather old-fashioned posters with little more than the names and faces of local politicians and their party affiliations. Free television advertisements will run on publicly financed stations. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb Chris Cottrell contributed reporting."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/23\/business\/global\/cyprus-is-very-close-to-bailout-agreement-president-says.html","body":"NICOSIA \u2014 Cyprus is close to agreeing on a bailout package with international lenders, President Demetris Christofias said Thursday as officials from the lenders left the country after the latest round of talks.

The puzzle may be complete, but the hard work to create the medical school and an affiliated teaching hospital has just begun. Mr. Watson, however, praises the area\u2019s \u201cnew playbook\u201d for the project, in part because of the broad coalition of organizations involved. With affirmation from voters, those groups are finalizing the school\u2019s location, preparing to oversee its construction and developing the curriculum for the school, which could open as early as 2015, though William C. Powers Jr., president of U.T.-Austin. said 2016 was \u201cmore realistic.\u201d (U.T.-Austin is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.) \u201cWe all have our own little to-do lists,\u201d said Patricia Young Brown, the president and chief executive officer of Central Health, created in 2004 by Travis County to provide a health care safety net for the region\u2019s underserved populations. The new tax will generate $54 million annually to supplement Central Health\u2019s activities rather than pay for the bricks and mortar of new buildings. Of that total, $35 million will be set aside for medical school patient services, and the remainder will go toward other services. That revenue is also expected to draw up to an additional $76 million in federal matching money through a program aimed at transforming medical service delivery for needy patients, for a combined $130 million impact on the region\u2019s health care system. Since the vote, Ms. Brown\u2019s team has been putting together the paperwork to secure the federal financing, which is restricted from going toward the school\u2019s construction, but which she said could go toward indigent care, services that are a crucial part of the project because they fuel the environment in which the medical school will operate. \u201cIt\u2019s an education, training and service delivery ecosystem, and we rely on each other to make the whole thing work,\u201d she said. To put that money to best use, leaders are establishing an organization composed of health care providers. Central Health will be the majority stakeholder of what is being called the Community Care Collaborative.

And that, in turn, requires a rethinking of the balance between capital and labor. Over the last 30 years, wage growth has lagged behind productivity across the industrialized world, leading to a steep fall in wages, salaries and other employee benefits as a proportion of G.D.P. Simultaneously, there has been a big rise in inequality as the benefits of economic growth have accrued to those at the top of the income scale, as well as a steady increase in corporate income and profits. These trends have gone hand-in-hand with a steady decline in business investment. Europe\u2019s strategy for dealing with the euro zone crisis has exacerbated these trends and is therefore a further obstacle to economic recovery. European countries are relying on two things to boost investment and hence employment: First, they are trying to lower labor costs, make their business environments more attractive by switching the burden of taxation from the corporate sector to the consumer, pushing through labor reforms aimed at reducing workers\u2019 bargaining power and curtailing social rights and transfers. Second, they are attempting to boost business confidence by consolidating public finances. Such a strategy might make sense for individual countries, so long as they can rely on exports, but not for the European economy as a whole. The strategy promises to further aggravate Europe\u2019s core problem \u2014 a structural shortage of demand \u2014 by bringing about a further decline of labor income and a further rise in inequality. There is no doubting the need for reforms aimed at increasing competition and opening the way for the adoption of new technologies. But governments need to combine market-led reforms with measures aimed at preventing a further decline in labor\u2019s share of the pie. With households now highly indebted across the industrialized world, a sustained recovery in private consumption will require a rise in the share of national incomes accounted for by wages and salaries. There are a number of things governments can do. But some will require them to challenge firmly held assumptions, to work more closely together and to distance themselves from special pleading by business. \u2022There is some evidence that raising skills levels can combat inequality, and governments should certainly redouble their efforts to reduce the number of people who leave school early. But even countries that have well-trained work forces have experienced sharp falls in labor share and rising inequality. \u2022Executive remuneration needs to be linked to long-term performance, and not just to the share price. Executives\u2019 duty should be to the company, its long-term health and those who work for it. This would encourage a greater emphasis on long-term organic growth (as opposed to expansion through mergers and acquisitions) and lower the excessive focus on reducing labor costs. The relationship between risk and reward must be rebuilt by reducing executive remuneration. \u2022Tax systems need to be more redistributive. The better-off need to pay more tax; those on lower incomes need to pay less. In tandem, governments should switch the burden of taxation from consumption to capital by reducing value-added taxes and increasing taxes on capital and wealth. There is no empirical evidence that this would hit investment or work incentives. In an effort to address beggar-thy-neighbor tax competition, the European Union should move to harmonize corporate tax bases and rates. \u2022Countries need to end their obsession with \u201ccompetitiveness.\u201d Competitiveness is relative; countries cannot all return to growth by becoming more competitive relative to one another. The policies employed to boost competitiveness threaten a further decline in labor share and rising inequality. Instead of competitiveness, European governments should be focused on boosting domestic demand. This will require expansionary macroeconomic policies. Monetary policy should be loosened further, and the European Union as a whole needs to put an end to fiscal austerity. \u2022Finally, governments should adopt a more skeptical ear when confronted with business lobbying. What might work for individual firms is at best zero-sum when adopted by countries. For their part, the leaders of finance and business need to recognize that their remuneration is an obstacle to the kinds of market-led reforms that they themselves advocate and that are needed to boost economic performance. What will happen if governments fail to change track? Economic recovery will prove elusive and public finances will remain chronically weak. This will exacerbate the legitimacy problems of markets, weaken social cohesion and undermine political effectiveness. Voters will associate structural reforms with declining living standards, increased insecurity and inequality. Not only will governments struggle to push through the needed reforms, but there will also be a risk of a broader backlash against the market economy and the European Union. Mainstream political parties are likely to lose much of their credibility, and euro-skepticism is likely to take hold as more populist politicians respond to mounting popular anger by becoming increasingly hostile to the European Union. Support for state control over capital is likely to rise as are demands for greater trade protectionism and tougher curbs on immigration. These are unlikely to prove transient trends: Events of this kind tend to influence attitudes for decades.

Ms. Merkel added, \u201cWe want Greece to remain in Europe.\u201d Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, said he was confident that an agreement could be reached once \u201ctechnical questions\u201d had been clarified. Euro zone finance ministers and international officials ended their latest meeting on Greece early Wednesday after failing to reach a breakthrough on Greek aid despite nearly 12 hours of intensive closed-door talks. It was the second consecutive week they reached such an impasse, highlighting deep divisions on how to find the money to keep the Greek economy afloat and prevent contagion in the euro zone even as the country\u2019s debt prospects worsen. Greece is seeking to unlock a 31.5 billion euro, or $40.4 billion, installment of loans from an international bailout program. If ministers do reach a deal, Greece is likely to get a larger amount of about 44 billion euros because two additional installments are due by the end of the year under the program. The current program, worth 130 billion euros, has been frozen since June, when creditors determined that Greece was failing to meet the conditions of the bailout. While there is little immediate threat that creditors will deny further aid to Athens, finding a formula to turn the spigot back on has proved incredibly difficult, particularly for Germany, where Ms. Merkel is seeking to avoid announcing losses on German loans or big new financing commitments to Greece ahead of her re-election campaign next year. That has left the euro zone\u2019s leadership and officials from the International Monetary Fund attending a seemingly endless series of late-night meetings. \u201cThe fund knows they can\u2019t push the big creditor nations like Germany to cough up enough money for a systemic fix for Greece given the German election cycle and because such a fix also would meet strong opposition from powerful parliamentary committees in countries like Finland,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, a Europe analyst at the Eurasia Group. \u201cSo instead, the fund is pushing creditor nations like Germany as far as possible on everything else. The fund wants to be as aggressive as it can be without actually demanding creditor nations take haircuts on their loans.\u201d On Tuesday night, ministers examined options, including lowering interest rates on Greek debt, lengthening the deadlines for repayments and allowing Greece to buy back its bonds at a steep discount. Once lenders agree on a solution for Greece, the measure will still have to be debated and passed by German lawmakers. Mr. Sch\u00e4uble said on Monday that the German Parliament could put the issue to a vote by the end of next week if an agreement was reached Monday. But the holdup immediately prompted the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, to insist that Athens had already carried out promised reforms and should receive its bailout money. \u201cGreece did what it had to do and what it had pledged to do,\u201d Mr. Samaras said. \u201cOur partners, and the I.M.F., must now assume their responsibilities.\u201d \u201cWhatever the technical difficulties involved in finding a solution, they do not justify any negligence or delay,\u201d said Mr. Samaras. The holdup also prompted renewed criticism of Mr. Samaras and of Greece\u2019s foreign bailout by Alexis Tsipras, the leader of the leftist opposition party Syriza, which is leading in opinion polls. \u201cSamaras has become an integral part of the pre-election campaign of Ms. Merkel, who does not want to admit to the German people before German elections that she has made serious mistakes, that she is to blame for the oncoming recession and that a haircut is necessary for Greece\u2019s debt,\u201d Mr. Tsipras said in a statement. The meeting broke up on Wednesday morning with Greece\u2019s biggest creditors like Germany at loggerheads with the I.M.F. over how much extra financing to provide in the next four years, and over whether Greece\u2019s towering debt must be reduced to 120 percent of gross domestic product by the end of the decade. Christine Lagarde, the I.M.F.\u2019s managing director, had insisted that financing Greece to 2016 would help it make its debt manageable by the end of the decade. But a number of member states resisted that suggestion, insisting on limiting questions to how to finance Greece through 2014. Using a target date of 2014 would cost less, or about 15 billion euros, but that would leave questions unresolved about the country\u2019s financing.

H.P. contends that such accounting improprieties were behind more than $5 billion of the $8.8 billion charge. For some analysts, that didn't add up. \"Out of the $8.8 billion, I'd be very surprised if more than a couple of billion was due to accounting improprieties,\" said Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business. In other words, the skeptics say they think H.P. may be overstating the financial effects of the supposed accounting chicanery. They say that H.P.'s management may have wanted to write off as much of Autonomy as possible, and that the accounting allegations allowed it to increase the charge. This move, of course, hurt H.P's fourth-quarter earnings. But a big charge has the advantage of cleaning the slate for the next fiscal year for the company's chief executive, Meg Whitman. With Autonomy now only a small part of H.P.'s balance sheet, there is a much smaller chance that the troubled division will lead to more embarrassing write-downs. The Autonomy acquisition was initiated by H.P.'s previous chief executive, L\u00e9o Apotheker. Evaluating the validity of the charge requires understanding exactly what H.P. was writing down. When a company accounts for an acquisition, it assesses the value of the target, subtracting its liabilities from its assets. It then compares this so-called fair value with the price it is paying. If it is paying more than the fair value, the difference is recorded as good will on the buyer's balance sheet. When H.P. acquired Autonomy, it got roughly $4 billion of intangible assets (Autonomy's expertise, intellectual property and brand recognition) and recorded roughly $6 billion of good will. In the charge announced Tuesday, H.P. slashed the value of both, effectively saying Autonomy was worth 80 percent less than it originally thought. In some ways, an 80 percent reduction might seem deserved, if Autonomy was in fact cooking its books. But despite their accusations, H.P. executives in a conference call did not seem to present a dire picture of Autonomy. The ruses, if that's what they were, helped revenue and profits, but probably not enough to account for $5 billion of the charge, said Anup Srivastava, an assistant professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. \"I can't justify it,\" he said. Autonomy's revenue benefited from one alleged ruse, but only by 10 to 15 percent, according to Hewlett. Catherine A. Lesjak, the H.P. chief financial officer, said Tuesday that without accounting tricks, Autonomy would have appeared less profitable. But it was still making money, according to her figures. Without the tricks, Ms. Lesjak said, Autonomy probably had operating margins as high as 30 percent, compared with as much as 45 percent with them. And on Tuesday, Ms. Whitman said Autonomy could still be something of a \"growth engine\" for H.P. Still, some people think the charge may be reasonable. In assessing the size of an impairment charge, companies focus on projections of cash flows from the affected divisions. If H.P. can show that Autonomy's cash generation is far below its expectations, and that cooking the books largely hid that, the charge may be sound, said Cynthia Jeffrey, associate professor of accounting at Iowa State University. \"If there's fraud involved and that wasn't found during due diligence, the whole thing could be valueless,\" she said. H.P. could argue that the high valuation it placed on Autonomy's cash flows looks all the more untenable in light of the legerdemain allegations, and that that's why it had to take the charge. When asked to comment on the charge, an H.P. spokesman, Michael Kuczkowski, e-mailed a list of what he said were the improper accounting maneuvers at Autonomy. \"Because our investigation into the accounting improprieties and misrepresentations at Autonomy remains ongoing, and given our referral of this matter to regulatory authorities in the U.S. and the U.K., it would not be appropriate for us to provide a more detailed description at this time,\" he said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/22\/sports\/football\/jets-owner-woody-johnson-balances-football-and-politics.html","body":"The duality of Woody Johnson\u2019s life over the last two years was on full display two weeks ago, on a crisp Tuesday night in Boston. As election results started pouring in at Mitt Romney\u2019s party at the city\u2019s convention center, Johnson sat sending e-mail after e-mail to Jets executives in New Jersey.It was a telling moment for Johnson, who has balanced these twin pursuits \u2014 owning one of the N.F.L.\u2019s more valuable franchises and serving as a critical member of the Romney campaign\u2019s fund-raising team \u2014 while edging closer into public view, continuing a transformation from reclusive billionaire. But that moment also came on a night of great disappointment. For years, the Jets could not escape the considerable shadow of the Giants, an existence that has changed in the Rex Ryan era through a combination of personality and on-field success. The Jets remain a formidable source of attention, but for different reasons. Tim Tebow. An eroded talent base. Another round of anonymous sniping. Johnson said he would rather Romney move into the White House than the Jets savor a winning season. Barack Obama secured a second term as president, and the Jets are still struggling, at 4-9 over their last 13 games and 4-6 this season, toiling on the periphery of the playoff picture. On Thursday night, while Americans sit in front of the television after their annual gorging, Johnson\u2019s team will face its fiercest rival, the New England Patriots, in a prime-time game that he requested. It will be another very public reckoning for something that Johnson holds dear \u2014 a high-profile moment in a year that has been filled with them. \u201cWhat I know is that Woody has three passions: curing lupus, having the Jets win a Super Bowl and his commitment to the Romney campaign,\u201d said Kenneth Farber, the president of the Alliance for Lupus Research, of which Johnson is chairman of the board, and a friend of his for nearly 30 years. Johnson\u2019s daughter Jaime has lupus. \u201cHe wants success for all of them, and he can be impatient in that sense,\u201d Farber said. \u201cWoody is not a lethargic guy, you know.\u201d Whenever possible, Johnson would front-load his schedule so that he spent the early part of the week involved in his political endeavors and the latter part focused on his team, with attending practice a priority. He devoted countless hours to supporting Romney, following him to Israel and Wyoming and Florida, where at the Republican National Convention in August he told CNBC that \u201cyou can never have too much Tebow.\u201d Inevitably, football intersected with politics on the campaign trail \u2014 sometimes by happenstance, as when donors who were fans of the Giants or the Patriots would introduce themselves as such, and other times by design. One of the few finance people deployed to speak on behalf of the campaign, Johnson appeared regularly on cable news programs, mixing thoughts on the economy with, when asked, views of his team. During the height of fund-raising season, in April, Johnson told Fox Business Network that the decision to acquire Tebow was a collaborative one. But, he added jokingly, if Tebow \u201cturns out to be a great player, I\u2019ll take full accountability for that.\u201d The Jets\u2019 sporadic use of Tebow has fueled the perception that the Jets acquired him not only to diversify their offense (which he has yet to do), but also to increase sales of personal seat licenses and to restore the spotlight on the team after a tumultuous off-season and the Giants\u2019 championship. Johnson condemned that notion last week, telling reporters that it was \u201cphony\u201d and that his job \u201cone, two and three is to win games \u2014 that\u2019s why I got into football.\u201d Johnson spoke to reporters that afternoon for the first time since the beginning of what he called a \u201cmiserable experience\u201d of a season, and he seemed as outwardly upset \u2014 with that perception, with the team\u2019s performance \u2014 as he has in some time. Those who have worked closely with Johnson characterize him as proactive and optimistic, someone who would rather plan for success than dwell on failures. He does not sit idly, they say. He demands response. He solicits solutions. He expects results. Searching for those results, Johnson summoned General Manager Mike Tannenbaum; the team\u2019s president, Neil Glat; and Coach Rex Ryan, as well as Ryan\u2019s three coordinators, for a meeting Nov. 13, two days after the Jets absorbed a third consecutive defeat \u2014 and a second straight by 21 points. Glat would not elaborate on the subject matter, but he said the meeting was \u201cincredibly productive and constructive.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s expressed disappointment with the team\u2019s record so far this season, but he\u2019s handled it in a \u2018here\u2019s where we are \u2014 now where do we go from here; how do we better?\u2019 kind of way,\u201d Glat said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s ups and downs in business or on the football field, I\u2019ve never seen him despondent. The focus has always been on moving forward.\u201d Associates of Johnson say that he is not prone to emotional outbursts. When the Jets are playing well, he cheers and offers the occasional high-five. When they are not \u2014 or he is disappointed for other reasons \u2014 he tends to get quiet, reflective. Johnson\u2019s experience dealing with the turbulent nature of presidential campaigns, with barrages of polls often stimulating hope and despair on the same day, has steeled him for the tumult of a football season \u2014 and, perhaps, vice versa. When it became apparent on election night that Romney would lose \u2014 but less clear that a concession speech was imminent \u2014 Johnson retired to his room at the Westin. He was exhausted and ready for bed, but then his cellphone rang. On the other line was Chris Applegate, a political adviser to Johnson, who had just encountered a few of Romney\u2019s sons by an elevator bank. They said they wanted to see Johnson. After he put his suit back on, Johnson joined Romney\u2019s family backstage. He gave Romney a hug before leaving, this time for good. The next morning, Johnson flew back to New York, back to the Jets."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/22\/opinion\/kristof-a-failed-experiment.html","body":"In upper-middle-class suburbs on the East Coast, the newest must-have isn\u2019t a $7,500 Sub-Zero refrigerator. It\u2019s a standby generator that automatically flips on backup power to an entire house when the electrical grid goes out.In part, that\u2019s a legacy of Hurricane Sandy. Such a system can cost well over $10,000, but many families are fed up with losing power again and again. (A month ago, I would have written more snarkily about residential generators. But then we lost power for 12 days after Sandy \u2014 and that was our third extended power outage in four years. Now I\u2019m feeling less snarky than jealous!) More broadly, the lust for generators is a reflection of our antiquated electrical grid and failure to address climate change. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave our grid, prone to bottlenecks and blackouts, a grade of D+ in 2009. So Generac, a Wisconsin company that dominates the generator market, says it is running three shifts to meet surging demand. About 3 percent of stand-alone homes worth more than $100,000 in the country now have standby generators installed. \u201cDemand for generators has been overwhelming, and we are increasing our production levels,\u201d Art Aiello, a spokesman for Generac, told me. That\u2019s how things often work in America. Half-a-century of tax cuts focused on the wealthiest Americans leave us with third-rate public services, leading the wealthy to develop inefficient private workarounds. It\u2019s manifestly silly (and highly polluting) for every fine home to have a generator. It would make more sense to invest those resources in the electrical grid so that it wouldn\u2019t fail in the first place. But our political system is dysfunctional: in addressing income inequality, in confronting climate change and in maintaining national infrastructure. The National Climatic Data Center has just reported that October was the 332nd month in a row of above-average global temperatures. As the environmental Web site Grist reported, that means that nobody younger than 27 has lived for a single month with colder-than-average global temperatures, yet climate change wasn\u2019t even much of an issue in the 2012 campaign. Likewise, the World Economic Forum ranks American infrastructure 25th in the world, down from 8th in 2003-4, yet infrastructure is barely mentioned by politicians. So time and again, we see the decline of public services accompanied by the rise of private workarounds for the wealthy. Is crime a problem? Well, rather than pay for better policing, move to a gated community with private security guards! Are public schools failing? Well, superb private schools have spaces for a mere $40,000 per child per year. Public libraries closing branches and cutting hours? Well, buy your own books and magazines! Are public parks \u2014 even our awesome national parks, dubbed \u201cAmerica\u2019s best idea\u201d and the quintessential \u201cpublic good\u201d \u2014 suffering from budget cuts? Don\u2019t whine. Just buy a weekend home in the country! Public playgrounds and tennis courts decrepit? Never mind \u2014 just join a private tennis club! I\u2019m used to seeing this mind-set in developing countries like Chad or Pakistan, where the feudal rich make do behind high walls topped with shards of glass; increasingly, I see it in our country. The disregard for public goods was epitomized by Mitt Romney\u2019s call to end financing of public broadcasting. A wealthy friend of mine notes that we all pay for poverty in the end. The upfront way is to finance early childhood education for at-risk kids. The back-end way is to pay for prisons and private security guards. In cities with high economic inequality, such as New York and Los Angeles, more than 1 percent of all employees work as private security guards, according to census data. This question of public goods hovers in the backdrop as we confront the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d and seek to reach a deal based on a mix of higher revenues and reduced benefits. It\u2019s true that we have a problem with rising entitlement spending, especially in health care. But I also wonder if we\u2019ve reached the end of a failed half-century experiment in ever-lower tax rates for the wealthy. Since the 1950s, the top federal income tax rate has fallen from 90 percent or more to 35 percent. Capital gains tax rates have been cut by more than half since the late 1970s. Financial tycoons now often pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries. All this has coincided with the decline of some public services and the emergence of staggering levels of inequality (granted, other factors are also at work) such that the top 1 percent of Americans now have greater collective net worth than the entire bottom 90 percent. Not even the hum of the most powerful private generator can disguise the failure of that long experiment."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/22\/business\/global\/22iht-nwqanda22.html","body":"Dr. Peter Brooks, a behavioral finance specialist at Barclays, advises relationship managers at the bank on how clients may be reacting to various market developments. He spoke recently about the current state of mind among clients and what he advises their managers to do.Q. How have the markets treated investors, emotionally, over the past few months? A. When the market started going south pretty quickly toward the end of the last summer, there was a very definite reaction \u2014 fear and panic \u2014 and the desire to make sure their assets were safe. Since then the market has risen again, and what we\u2019ve seen is a market that has been friendly to investors. It has not been very volatile, so consequently it has not been an uncomfortable experience. In recent months the relatively low volatility means the comfort levels of clients are actually much better. But there are many uncertainties lingering in the background, none of which are being resolved quickly \u2014 so there is an expectation of greater volatility in the coming months. Q. Investing is about the long term, while market movements are short-term phenomena. How do you address the conflict? A. The best thing to do is understand how the conflict may cause you to make certain decisions. The long term is about meeting our financial goals and objectives \u2014 often through a financial plan that is created during a period of calm reflection. The short term requires us to have the emotional resolve to staying invested in all market conditions and stick to our plan. Most of us care more about being comfortable today and become willing to deviate from our plans to gain additional comfort. We all have a different threshold for that and when we see the market dropping it can be hit very quickly for some. That\u2019s when we feel the need to do something to give us extra comfort in the short term even if we do not necessarily know what to do. It\u2019s something in behavioral finance we call the \u201caction bias\u201d: At times of stress we feel we need to do something. It is psychologically easier to justify doing something and not succeeding than it is to do nothing and not succeed. Q. How do signs of stress show up in a portfolio? A. In trading behavior. A stressed investor may have a desire to do something with their portfolio to make them more comfortable, but I don\u2019t necessarily know what that thing might be. We often see such clients selling risky assets and moving to cash when they become anxious. This type of behavior can be costly to long-term goals because the decision to get back into the markets is often hampered by the fear of loss, and consequently the investor may stay in cash too long and miss out on market rallies. Q. Is that what clients are doing now? A. No, clients are doing something much more subtle with their portfolios: rebalancing the risk. Clients stay invested when they are comfortable with the risk-and-return balance in their portfolio. They have to feel that when they are taking on certain level of risk that the expected returns are compensating them for that. In general, investors seem to be happy taking some risk at the moment. Q. That doesn\u2019t sound too bad. Is there a downside? A. Unfortunately this means they could be falling foul of another behavioral bias, the \u201cdisposition effect.\u201d You may have a number of positions that are showing small gains and a number of positions that are showing losses. The disposition effect makes you want to sell your winners because that makes you feel like a better investor. It\u2019s an understandable intuitive reaction, but it\u2019s one based upon looking at the wrong information. Many investors hold on to their losers because selling would suggest they\u2019ve made a bad investment choice. It touches their ego. There is also the hope that it will bounce back eventually and could be sold as a winner in the future. Q. And that\u2019s the wrong thing to do? A. The disposition effect is dangerous because you are focusing upon the past and not what the investment will do for the future. Often because we sell the winners and keep the losers, we end up reducing the number of good assets in our portfolio and perhaps increasing the sluggish one, which might take longer to gain value. You need to drill a little bit deeper and focus on what your expectation is for each asset in the future. You should keep the asset that has the best risk-return profile over the forthcoming investment period. It could be a recent winner, or it could be a recent loser. Q. If investors are rebalancing now, what are they choosing? 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9C06E3DD113AF931A15752C1A9649D8B63","body":"BIELER--Alan Wayne, age 50, of Manhattan, died on November 20, 2012.

Car horns honked. A man did a celebratory dance on the sidewalk. A girlfriend waited outside her house for a kiss. For a mill town that has known mostly defeat since the steel industry declined in the 1980s, football is bringing incessant victory.With a 37-7 playoff victory last Friday, Clairton (12-0) won its 59th consecutive game, tying a Pennsylvania record and extending the nation\u2019s longest current winning streak. A fourth consecutive Class A state championship is expected just before Christmas. If the town\u2019s industrial glory days ended long ago, they are renewed weekly on the football field. Tradition maintains that Pennsylvania\u2019s best high school football is played in gritty mill towns and coal hamlets. Certainly, western Pennsylvania has mined such greats as Unitas, Ditka, Namath, Dorsett, Montana and Marino. But populations shift. Demographics change. Schools merge or close. Football power has grown increasingly concentrated in the larger suburban public schools and Catholic schools in and around Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Harrisburg, the state capital. Clairton and Aliquippa are the exceptions, small mill towns that persist in uncertain times and field dominant teams. \u201cThe businesses have shuttered; we lost our mill, lost our grocery store,\u201d said Tom McCloskey, the principal at Clairton High School and an alumnus. \u201cIt seems the odds are stacked against the town. Football is a way we can persevere, ride the success of the team. A lot of people look forward to Friday night. Everybody comes together around one common good thing we\u2019ve got going on.\" Apart from providing community pride, football serves as a neon advertisement that, despite its troubles, Clairton remains open for business. In fiscal 2011, the city budget finished in the black for the first time in at least a decade. United States Steel has invested more than $500 million to upgrade the nation\u2019s largest coke plant here along the Monongahela River, 12 miles south of Pittsburgh. A grocery store is planned for next year. Real estate is plentiful and cheap. City leaders are somewhat encouraged, but they are also realistic. Football may not even save Clairton High School, much less rescue the city\u2019s flagging reputation. The school is one of the smallest and poorest in the state. Its future is indeterminate. As players make their ritual walk to the stadium each Friday, they climb through a downtown of abandoned storefronts: Flynn\u2019s Cleaners, Nettie\u2019s Place, Pat Dusi\u2019s Craft World, Miller Bar, Grisnik Bakery. The businesses meant family and deep roots, not merely commerce. Now the names read like civic tombstones. In its heyday, when the mill ran three shifts, 24\/7, Clairton supported three movie theaters, four car dealerships, a full-time recreation director. There was no urgent reason to travel upriver to Pittsburgh. Almost anything a person needed was here. Now the coke plant employs 1,300 workers, compared with 5,000 at the height of the steel industry, according to the local union. Residents must drive five miles out of town simply to buy fresh produce. A population that peaked at 19,652 with the 1950 census shrank to 6,796 by 2010. Nearly a quarter of the residents live below the poverty level \u2014 double the state average. Two hundred commercial and residential structures stand empty, many with their exteriors collapsing, their interiors scavenged. More than $3 million in local real estate taxes is owed on 1,000 vacant lots, but the money will never be collected, the city manager said, because the landowners have died or moved elsewhere. Lincoln Way is a desolate archetype of industrial decline, every one of the street\u2019s 25 houses empty or torn down.

The German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble told reporters after nearly 12 hours of talks that some of \u201cthe questions are so complicated we didn\u2019t find a conclusive solution\u201d and he said finance ministers would meet again on Monday to resume the discussions. Mr. Sch\u00e4uble also noted that European leaders could take up the discussions during a two-day summit here that begins Thursday. While there is little immediate threat that creditors will deny further aid to the government in Athens, finding a formula to turn the spigot back on has proved intensely difficult, particularly for Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking to avoid making new financing commitments to the most vulnerable euro area countries like Greece ahead of her re-election campaign next year. That has left the leadership of the euro zone jawboning at a seemingly endless series of late-night meetings. Greece is seeking to unlock a 31.5 billion euros, or $40.2 billion, installment of loans from an international bailout program. If ministers do reach a deal, Greece is likely to get a larger amount of about 44 billion euros ($56 billion) because two additional installments are due by the end of the year under the program. The current program, worth 130 billion euros (167 billion), has been frozen since June, when creditors determined that Greece was failing to meet the conditions of the bailout. During the closed-door discussions that began on Tuesday evening, ministers and international officials also were at loggerheads over whether to give Greece two more years, to 2016, to reach a primary budget surplus, a concession requiring nearly 33 billion euros ($42 billion) on top of existing bailouts. Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, insisted that financing Greece to 2016 would help it to the path of making its debt manageable by the end of the decade. But a number of member states resisted that suggestion, insisting on limiting questions of how to finance Greece thru 2014. Using a target date of 2014 would cost less, or about 15 billion euros, ($19 billion) but that would leave questions unresolved about the country\u2019s financing. In an effort to address the added costs, the ministers ranged over options from lowering interest rates on Greek debt, lengthening the deadlines for debt repayments, allowing Greece to buy back its bonds at a steep discount, and asking the European Central Bank to return profits made on Greek bonds. But many analysts agree that at some point, Greece\u2019s official lenders will have to take politically unpalatable losses, or haircuts, on their holdings of Greek debt in order to keep the country in the euro area, even if a range of other measures is taken to reduce the size of the state deficit and reform the economy. Another critical challenge for the Eurogroup was smoothing over differences among the troika of lenders \u2014 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 about how quickly Greece should be obliged to bring its towering debt under control. In a public disagreement last week at the previous Eurogroup meeting, Ms. Lagarde insisted that Greece cut its debt to the fund\u2019s target of 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020 while\u00a0Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the Eurogroup, recommended giving Greece until 2022, a position shared by Germany. Arriving at the meeting on Tuesday, Ms. Lagarde emphasized the importance of the 2020 goal to her organization, which, under its rules, cannot continue lending unless Greece\u2019s debt is deemed sustainable. Finding a solution was \u201cour goal, our purpose and our mission,\u201d she said. The difference is a highly sensitive matter for Greece\u2019s biggest creditors in the euro zone, and for Germany in particular. German leadership is wary of political repercussions from higher costs that would result from meeting the 2020 deadline. The Greek debt is now estimated at 175 percent of G.D.P. and the economy could shrink again next year. \u201cWe are narrowing our positions,\u201d Mr. Juncker told reporters early on Wednesday morning referring to gulf between him and Ms. Lagarde on Greece\u2019s debt prospects. \u201cWe are very close to a result\u201d and there was \u201cno major stumbling block,\u201d Mr. Juncker insisted. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras of Greece, who is struggling to hold together an increasingly fragile coalition, hopes that a final push by Athens to tie up loose ends could help speed money for the two-year extension to the country\u2019s fiscal adjustment period. Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said late Sunday that Athens had done its bit. \u201cWe are fully ready for Tuesday,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no outstanding issues on our side.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9C04E7DF1338F932A15752C1A9649D8B63","body":"When Goldman Sachs fires you as a client, you probably have a problem. That appears to have happened last month, when Goldman withdrew as the lead underwriter for the initial public offering of the Russian cellphone operator MegaFon on the London Stock Exchange. The multibillion-dollar offering, the largest I.P.O. since Facebook, is nonetheless hurtling forward, highlighting a flawed system. MegaFon is the second-largest mobile phone operator in Russia, with about 63 million customers, behind Mobile TeleSystems and ahead of Vimpelcom, both of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. MegaFon is controlled by one of Russia's richest men, Alisher Usmanov, who is well connected with the Kremlin and has interests around the globe. (For one thing, he controls a roughly 29 percent stake in the London soccer team Arsenal.) The I.P.O. is happening largely as a result of a battle for control between Mr. Usmanov and two other big shareholders, TeliaSonera, the Stockholm-based telecommunications giant, and Alfa-Bank, the large financial conglomerate controlled by another Russian billionaire, Mikhail Fridman. A settlement among the warring parties was reached in April, with Alfa selling its 25 percent interest in MegaFon for $5.2 billion to Mr. Usmanov and his associates and TeliaSonera shedding part of its stake. The London offering is meant for TeliaSonera to sell down its stake to around 25 percent from 37.5 percent. Mr. Usmanov would then control 50 percent and one share of MegaFon. After the I.P.O., about 15 percent of the company's shares will be held by the public. The offering hit a road bump in October, when Goldman withdrew as the lead underwriter, giving up tens of millions of dollars in potential fees. The firm did not publicly disclose its reason, but a person close to the transaction said that Goldman withdrew because Mr. Usmanov wanted to place his controlling ownership in a holding company with his other investments, including his Arsenal stake and the ore mining company Metalloinvest. The problem was that the holding company would be owned by Mr. Usmanov and Farhad Moshiri, who co-owns Usmanov's Arsenal stake, and Vladimir Skoch, the father of Andrei Skoch, a prominent Russian oligarch and member of the Russian parliament who also owns part of Metalloinvest. Goldman felt that it did not have enough time to scrutinize the structure, and so it withdrew, according to this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity. From the beginning of the I.P.O. process, there had been worries that a publicly held MegaFon would be controlled by elements other than Mr. Usmanov. This concern is typical in Russia, because the country has a weak rule of law, share ownership is murky and controlling shareholders have not been shy about leveraging their political power to shove out pesky minority owners. Mr. Usmanov is a reflection of this world. An extremely successful businessman, Mr. Usmanov was imprisoned in Uzbekistan for six years after being convicted on charges of corruption in the 1980s. Mr. Usmanov strongly contends that the charges and imprisonment were trumped up and politically motivated and claims that his record was subsequently expunged. And false imprisonment was certainly something that happened during Soviet rule. But the new structure and the uncertainty about doing business in Russia, and the always looming issue of political involvement, may well have persuaded Goldman to withdraw. When asked about these issues, MegaFon declined to comment, citing legal restrictions in the United States relating to publicity for the offering. It may turn out that the concerns over MegaFon amount to much of nothing. Indeed, after Goldman's pullout, Mr. Usmanov announced that he would maintain voting control of the holding company, an announcement that was probably intended to satisfy people concerned with the corporate governance aspect of this deal. Earlier this week, the company announced that Paul Myners, a former British Treasury minister, would join the board, further beefing up its governance. Still, it is telling that when Goldman dropped out, none of the other underwriters followed suit. The I.P.O., now scheduled for the end of this month, has been delayed for a few weeks, but Morgan Stanley and Sberbank CIB continue as lead underwriters. Citigroup, Credit Suisse and VTB are also part of the syndicate. The only real holdup appears to be a more extended review by the British listing authority. This is no surprise. There is always a prominent bank willing to step into any deal. But this is not how the market is supposed to work. Underwriters are meant to vet clients and work only on offerings that make sense. This duty has been diluted over the years, to the extent it ever existed, by the willingness of investors to overlook a company's flaws and invest in the next hot issue. And so banks have blindly followed heed, failing to fulfill their gatekeeping responsibilities. There are plenty of other examples. Take the Facebook offering. Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter, appeared unwilling to push back on its prominent client, and the market became overstuffed with Facebook shares. And how else to explain I.P.O. disasters like Caesars Entertainment, which went public in February at $9 a share, closed that day at $15.39 and is now worth less than $5 a share? The company had too much debt for the public markets, but Credit Suisse and Citigroup, the lead underwriters, still sold it. Earlier, there was the dot-com bubble. I could go on. And that is why the Goldman withdrawal is a big deal. That a big bank would pull out indicates that someone on Wall Street is starting to have qualms about what gets taken to market these days. There may just be a recognition by Goldman, however belated, that underwriting means something more than simply selling anything it can. MegaFon is attractive to investors because it is a growth company and promises to pay a dividend with a 7 to 8 percent yield, an extraordinarily high rate of return in today's low interest-rate environment. Investors may overlook the corporate governance risks and rush to buy shares like lemmings over the proverbial cliff. Given what's happened over the last decade, no one would really be surprised that once again, investors sometimes can't help themselves. And, if so, we may also be asking again, where were the gatekeepers? This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

He came not to defend the past, nor to apologize for it. In fact, he made no public mention of it whatsoever.President Obama\u2019s visit to a country deeply scarred by its involvement with the United States did nothing to purge the ghosts or even address them. Mr. Obama made clear he came only because Cambodia happened to be the site for a summit meeting of Asian leaders, but given the current government\u2019s human rights record, he was intent on avoiding much interaction with the host. \u201cHow are you?\u201d Mr. Obama asked Prime Minister Hun Sen when he showed up, unsmiling, for a meeting made necessary by protocol. \u201cGood to see you.\u201d Those, as it turned out, were the only words he uttered publicly to or about Cambodia during his two days here. In private, aides said, Mr. Obama pressed Mr. Hun Sen about repression. While they usually characterize even the most hostile meeting in diplomatic terms, in this case they were eager to call the meeting \u201ctense.\u201d But the president\u2019s public silence disappointed human rights organizations that had called for a more explicit challenge to Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s record of crushing opposition. And it left to another day any public examination of the United States\u2019 role in the events of the 1970s that culminated in the infamous \u201ckilling fields\u201d that wiped out a generation of Cambodians. Theary Seng, president of the Association of Khmer Rouge Victims in Cambodia, said, \u201cPresident Obama should have met with the human rights community and activists challenging the Hun Sen regime, and while then and there, offer a public apology to the Cambodian people for the illegal U.S. bombings, which took the lives of half a million Cambodians and created the conditions for the Khmer Rouge genocide.\u201d Gary J. Bass, a scholar of war crimes at Princeton, said Mr. Obama passed up a chance to publicly exorcise a painful history. \u201cIt\u2019s a missed opportunity for Obama,\u201d he said. \u201cObama is right to evoke America\u2019s better angels, but that\u2019s more effective when you give the complete story.\u201d White House officials were sympathetic, but they said the focus of Mr. Obama\u2019s stop in Phnom Penh was on the summit meeting, organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, not on a visit to Cambodia or the relationship between the two countries. \u201cIt\u2019s not a lack of appreciation; it\u2019s the circumstances of the visit,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the president\u2019s deputy national security adviser. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s always willing to confront the history we have in the nations we visit and believes it\u2019s important to acknowledge the past so we can move beyond it. The fact is, this particular visit was structured to focus on the summits that the Cambodians were hosting.\u201d Some activists said that Mr. Obama\u2019s visit would help Cambodia\u2019s transition. \u201cThe U.S. president\u2019s visit to Cambodia is an important part of that process,\u201d said Youk Chhang, a survivor of the genocide and executive director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, a private research group. \u201cCambodians look to the United States more than any other country as a beacon for leadership on human rights and democracy issues as well as what can be achieved by a free and fair market system.\u201d Michael Abramowitz, who directs the genocide prevention center at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, recently visited Cambodia on a fact-finding mission on the Khmer Rouge trials. He saw value in Mr. Obama\u2019s visit. \u201cEven though President Obama would likely not have visited Phnom Penh were it not for the Asean meeting, the presence of the first U.S. president on Cambodian soil has enormous symbolic importance,\u201d he said. Left undiscussed during the visit was the grim history between the United States and Cambodia. President Richard M. Nixon, trying to cut off North Vietnamese infiltration into South Vietnam, ordered a secret bombing campaign that dropped hundreds of thousands of tons of explosives on Cambodia from 1970 to 1973. The United States also backed a coup that ousted Norodom Sihanouk as head of state. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/21\/us\/us-and-mexico-sign-deal-on-managing-colorado-river.html","body":"CORONADO, Calif. \u2014 The governments of the United States and Mexico signed an agreement on Tuesday to overhaul how the two countries share and manage water from the Colorado River, which provides water to more than 33 million people in seven states and Mexico.Under the agreement, the two countries will share in both surpluses and water shortages. During drought years in the United States, less water will be sent to Mexico. In exchange, during years of plenty, Mexico will be allowed to store some of its water north of its border. In addition, the countries will allocate some water to restore the ecological health of the river\u2019s delta in Mexico. Speaking at the signing of the agreement here, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar called it the most important adjustment to rules on the Colorado River since the 1944 treaty between the two countries that set the terms for use of the river\u2019s water. Mr. Salazar said he hoped the new agreement would be the end of \u201cwater wars,\u201d which in times of drought have pitted those who rely on the river against each other. The 1,450-mile river runs from the Rockies to the Gulf of California. \u201cThe Colorado River, in so many ways, makes us one people, and together we face the risk of reduced supplies in years ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than ever, we are working together in times of drought as well as in times of abundance. We will cooperate to share, store and conserve water as needed.\u201d Until now, the United States has sent 1.5 million acre-feet of water from the Colorado to Mexico every year, regardless of rainfall. With more dry years recently, however, American officials wanted to reduce the amount it shares with Mexico when the river\u2019s level was low. In return, Mexico, which had little storage capacity, will be allowed to store some of its surplus water in Lake Mead, which straddles Nevada and Arizona. That will keep the water level there more predictable. Lake Mead supplies water to the Las Vegas area. In addition, the United States will help finance improvements to Mexico\u2019s water infrastructure, which was badly damaged by an earthquake in 2010. Finally, the agreement will reconnect the Colorado River with the Gulf of California. Currently, it peters out about 60 miles short of the sea. That will help to restore the river delta, which experts said had become desertlike. The United States and Mexican governments will each supply 5,000 acre-feet of water a year to the delta, as will a coalition of environmental organizations. Native plants from the delta will also be restored, which will provide a habitat for migratory birds. \u201cThis agreement is a model for how we need to be doing water management in the future,\u201d said Taylor Hawes, the director of the Colorado River Program for the Nature Conservancy, one of the nongovernmental organizations that will help supply water to the delta. \u201cThis is our hope for how we can manage rivers in a way that works for multiple parties and multiple interests in the future.\u201d The agreement runs for five years, after which, officials on both sides said, they hoped to reach a new agreement that would extend its principles."},{"url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9C01E0DD1F38F932A15752C1A9649D8B63","body":"CORRECTION APPENDED When Goldman Sachs fires you as a client, you probably have a problem. That appears to have happened last month, when Goldman withdrew as the lead underwriter for the initial public offering of the Russian cellphone operator MegaFon on the London Stock Exchange. The multibillion-dollar offering, the largest I.P.O. since Facebook, is nonetheless hurtling forward, highlighting a flawed system. MegaFon is the second-largest mobile phone operator in Russia, with about 63 million customers, behind Mobile TeleSystems and ahead of Vimpelcom, both of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. MegaFon is controlled by one of Russia's richest men, Alisher Usmanov, who is well connected with the Kremlin and has interests around the globe. (For one thing, he controls a roughly 29 percent stake in the London soccer team Arsenal.) The I.P.O. is happening largely as a result of a battle for control between Mr. Usmanov and two other big shareholders, TeliaSonera, the Stockholm-based telecommunications giant, and Alfa-Bank, the large financial conglomerate controlled by another Russian billionaire, Mikhail Fridman. A settlement among the warring parties was reached in April, with Alfa selling its 25 percent interest in MegaFon for $5.2 billion to Mr. Usmanov and his associates and TeliaSonera shedding part of its stake.

Unhappy with the business's sagging performance, H.P. ousted the software company's mercurial Cambridge-educated founder and sent a team to England to review its books last May. It was then that a senior finance official at the British company stepped forward, raising questions about the accuracy of the numbers. Months of investigation followed, prompting Hewlett's accusations on Tuesday that the British software maker, Autonomy, had engaged in \"serious accounting improprieties.\" Before the deal, H.P. claimed, Autonomy inflated its sales. The problems went undetected by outside accountants - both Autonomy's auditors and a firm H.P. hired to vet the deal. The accounting issues at Autonomy, which sells software that examines data for patterns, cost Hewlett more than $5 billion. Now, the Autonomy matter has been referred to regulators in two countries, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened a case, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. H.P. is also considering its own legal action. \"This took time\" to uncover, said Meg Whitman, H.P.'s chief executive. The issues, she said, \"were designed to be hidden.\" Hewlett can't escape the onslaught of bad news. In recent years, what was once a giant of Silicon Valley has been buffeted by management turnover, board controversy and waning profits. The company, which previously rivaled the likes of I.B.M., Cisco and SAP, has watched the value of its stock erode sharply. Even before the accounting problems, the Autonomy acquisition looked troubled. Within weeks, the deal contributed to the downfall of the chief executive at H.P. and led to squabbles among company's directors, including Ms. Whitman, who took over in September 2011. In the latest quarter, the company reported a $6.9 billion loss, dragged down by the Autonomy mess and continuing problems in the business that resulted in an overall charge of $8.8 billion. On Tuesday, the stock continued falling, dropping 12 percent to less than $12, its lowest point since 2002. \"We intend to be very aggressive in recovering value for our shareholders,\" said John Schultz, H.P.'s chief counsel. Individuals will be examined as well as accounting firms, he said, adding, \"we're not limiting it to Autonomy.\" Autonomy's founder, Mike Lynch, rejected Hewlett-Packard's claims, denying that his former company committed any accounting chicanery or misled anyone about its financial information. He indicated that the company's practices were in line with international accounting standards. \"It's completely and utterly wrong,\" Mr. Lynch said. The deal was criticized at the outset. In August 2011, H.P.'s chief executive at the time, L\u00e9o Apotheker, shifted strategy unexpectedly. All in the same announcement, Mr. Apotheker disclosed plans to buy Autonomy, killed two major products and publicly mused about selling the company's personal computing business. While many Wall Street analysts said H.P. was overpaying for Autonomy, Mr. Apotheker believed that H.P., which sells printers and computer servers as well as PCs, needed to move more aggressively into software. In buying Autonomy, he was buying into one of the biggest trends in tech, the analysis of voluminous data. Autonomy specializes in finding patterns among so-called unstructured data, like e-mails, online video, or web surfing. Mr. Lynch is a Cambridge-trained Ph.D. in signal processing who previously founded a company that searched for fingerprint patterns. He made a reported $800 million from the sale of Autonomy. A brilliant man known for a brutish office manner, he bonded with Mr. Apotheker, a multilingual German software executive. But within weeks of striking the deal, Mr. Apotheker was out, and Ms. Whitman was named to the top spot. During the deal negotiations, she had complained about the Autonomy price to other board members, according to several people briefed on the matter. Mr. Lynch's other close ally at H.P. during the sale of Autonomy, a chief technology officer named Shane Robison, left H.P. toward the end of 2011. Early in her tenure, Ms. Whitman resolved to increase Autonomy's customer base with existing H.P. clients, and to look for ways to put the software inside H.P. products. Ms. Whitman and other executives gushed about the opportunities, describing ways Autonomy's number-crunching technology could take on I.B.M. in data analysis, and Amazon.com in cloud computing services. Behind the scenes, the situation was less sunny. After securing the deal, Mr. Lynch tried to keep Autonomy far from H.P.'s bureaucracy. He mostly worked in London, and initially kept Autonomy's main office in a San Francisco high-rise decorated with pictures of famous theoretical mathematicians, and not at H.P.'s Palo Alto headquarters."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/21\/business\/global\/a-call-for-japan-to-take-bolder-monetary-action.html","body":"TOKYO \u2014 Act irresponsibly.For years, proponents of aggressive monetary policy have offered this unusual piece of advice as a way to end Japan\u2019s deflationary slump and invigorate the economy. Print lots of money, they said. Keep interest rates at zero. Convince the market that Japan will allow inflation for a while. Japan\u2019s central bankers long scoffed at such recklessness, which they feared would ignite runaway inflation. But now, the bank\u2019s hand could be forced by an unlikely alliance of economists and lawmakers who have argued for Japan to take more monetary action after more than a decade of weak growth and depressed prices. Championing their cause is the former prime minister Shinzo Abe, who is favored to return to the top job after nationwide elections next month. Otherwise deeply conservative, Mr. Abe surprised even his own supporters by calling for the Bank of Japan to be much bolder in tackling deflation, the damaging fall in prices, profits and wages that has choked Japan\u2019s economy for 15 years. In escalating remarks over the last week, Mr. Abe has said that he will press the Bank of Japan to act on government orders if his Liberal Democratic Party wins the Dec. 16 election and even rewrite Japanese law to reduce the bank\u2019s independence. In a speech in Tokyo on Thursday, Mr. Abe said he would call for the Bank of Japan to set an inflation target of 2 to 3 percent, far above its current goal of about 1 percent, with an explicit commitment to \u201cunlimited monetary easing\u201d \u2014 an open-endedness that has caused jitters among some economists. The bank\u2019s benchmark interest rate should be brought back to zero percent from 0.1 percent, Mr. Abe added. He went even further over the weekend, saying in the southern city of Kumamoto that he would consider having the bank buy construction bonds directly from the government to finance public works and force money into the economy, according to local news reports. That raises concerns, however, the bank may be called on to bankroll unrestrained spending on more roads and bridges that Japan does not need. Still, Mr. Abe\u2019s comments initially galvanized markets, sending the Nikkei soaring by almost 500 points since Thursday, falling back slightly Tuesday. The yen, which would weaken if Japan loosened monetary policy, has fallen 2.5 percent, much to the relief of Japanese exporters who benefit from a weak currency. \u201cIt\u2019s been long coming, but we finally have hope for change,\u201d said Kikuo Iwata, a professor in monetary economics at Gakushuin University in Tokyo and a longtime advocate of more aggressive easing. \u201cIf Mr. Abe becomes prime minister, he will not let the Bank of Japan play defense any longer.\u201d The strong reaction to mere comments from a candidate \u2014 before any fresh easing has actually taken place \u2014 demonstrates one of the less understood aspects of monetary policy: that expectations can matter more than policy. The Bank of Japan, which wrapped up a policy meeting on Tuesday, held policy steady. The bank has in fact tried a series of measures to reinflate Japan\u2019s economy over the years, including zero interest rates, asset purchases and quantitative easing. But prices have fallen for so long in Japan \u2014 since 1998, in fact \u2014 that Japanese have come to expect deflation. Try as it might, the Bank of Japan has been unable to change that expectation. Economists cite several missteps by the central bank that have entrenched Japan\u2019s deflationary mind-set and made consumers and businesses wary that the bank\u2019s policies will stick. In early 1999, as the country\u2019s economic woes deepened, the bank lowered a benchmark interest rate to virtually zero and said it would keep rates at zero until deflationary concerns disappeared. But an economic uptick in mid-2000 caused the bank to raise that rate to 0.25 percent despite protests from the government that the move was premature. Behind that quick reversal is what critics call Japan\u2019s severe phobia to any sign of an economic bubble. Japan has never recovered from its bubble economy of the 1980s, when stock and land prices quadrupled, only to tumble to almost prebubble levels as the country sunk into economic stagnation in the 1990s. Since then, critics say, the central bank has been so terrified of any sign of rising prices that it has held off from going all-out to fend off deflation, which has ultimately prolonged Japan\u2019s economic malaise. Even after the central bank returned to a zero interest rate in 2001 and introduced quantitative easing, it was careful to publicize concerns about inflation and warn that it would tighten monetary policy as soon as prices began to rise. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/21\/world\/asia\/india-police-arrest-student-over-facebook-post.html","body":"NEW DELHI \u2014 When the right-wing Hindu political leader Bal K. Thackeray died last weekend, the city of Mumbai responded with a practiced, if anxious, efficiency. Merchants hurriedly closed their shops. Traffic thickened as people tried to rush home. India\u2019s most populous city, a global financial center and moviemaking capital, was effectively shut down.Shaheen Dhada, 21, a medical student who lives on the outskirts of Mumbai, was a bit annoyed. Like most people, she understood what was happening: Mr. Thackeray\u2019s hard-line Shiv Sena party has dominated Mumbai for decades, often using intimidation, violence or vandalism to enforce citywide strikes or bans against certain movies. This time, Shiv Sena wanted a citywide signal of deference and respect for Mr. Thackeray. Ms. Dhada decided to post a mild message of protest on her Facebook page. Why, she asked, should an entire city be involuntarily shuttered to mark the death of a politician? Her friend, Renu Srinivasan, 20, read the post and hit \u201clike.\u201d The post went up on Sunday. Within hours, a Shiv Sena official had complained to the police, who notified Ms. Dhada\u2019s family. Intimidated, she quickly posted an apology and closed her Facebook account, her lawyer said. But by Monday, Ms. Dhada and Ms. Srinivasan had been arrested and charged with engaging in speech that was offensive and hateful \u2014 for a post that many experts say was neither. India is often regarded as one of the world\u2019s most freewheeling democracies, where citizens are forever voicing their opinions or participating in political protests. But the Facebook arrests have spiraled into a national controversy about the limits on free speech, the broad discretion granted to the authorities to curb online commentary and the professionalism of an Indian police force often beholden to political parties. \u201cWe have bad laws when it comes to regulation of speech,\u201d said Pranesh Prakash, policy director of the Center for Internet and Society in Bangalore. \u201cSome types of speech are illegal online even though they are perfectly legal in print or other media.\u201d For many of Ms. Dhada\u2019s supporters, the case reeks of systemic hypocrisy. When the police received the complaint from a local Shiv Sena chief on Sunday evening, officers acted rapidly, calling Ms. Dhada\u2019s uncle, a physician, and demanding that his niece apologize. In the complaint, Ms. Dhada\u2019s lawyer said, Shiv Sena declared that the post by Ms. Dhada \u2014 a Muslim \u2014 had disrespected the Hindu religion as well as Mr. Thackeray, whom Shiv Sena regarded as a Hindu god. Yet less than an hour after the complaint was filed, Shiv Sena supporters vandalized an orthopedic hospital owned by Ms. Dhada\u2019s uncle, who later filed a police complaint. \u201cA mob of 400 or 500 persons ransacked the hospital,\u201d said Sudhir Gupta, the lawyer for Ms. Dhada. \u201cThe police failed to protect the hospital.\u201d Social media have served as a primary channel of criticism about Ms. Dhada\u2019s arrest, with tens of thousands of comments made on Twitter and Facebook. Much of the criticism voiced online and by legal experts has focused on the Information Technology Act of 2008. The law was overhauled after the November 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai to grant the government broader powers to combat cybercrime, among other things. Yet many critics and legal experts argue that politicians, in some cases, are using the broad language to stifle dissent. This month, a man in southern India, writing on Twitter, suggested that the son of India\u2019s finance minister had amassed huge wealth through corruption. The minister\u2019s son filed a complaint with the local police, who quickly arrested the author of the Twitter comment. \u201cThe law is so broad, it gives unbridled power to the authorities to register a case,\u201d said Pavan Duggal, a lawyer who practices before India\u2019s Supreme Court and specializes in Internet law. \u201cIt leaves everything to the subjective discretion of the law enforcement authorities.\u201d In her Facebook post, Ms. Dhada questioned the public frenzy over Mr. Thackeray\u2019s death and noted that, by comparison, several of the freedom fighters of India\u2019s independence movement have mostly been forgotten. \u201cWith all respect,\u201d she began, according to a transcription in The Hindu, a leading national newspaper, \u201cevery day, thousands of people die, but still the world moves on. Just due to one politician died a natural death, everyone just goes bonkers. They should know, we are resilient by force, not by choice. When was the last time, did anyone showed some respect or even a two-minute silence for Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Azad, Sukhdev or any of the people because of whom we are free-living Indians? \u201cRespect is earned, given, and definitely not forced,\u201d she concluded. \u201cToday, Mumbai shuts down due to fear, not due to respect.\u201d Mr. Thackeray, who died Saturday at age 86, left a controversial legacy. He once spoke admiringly of Hitler and won power in Mumbai by playing to the grievances of the local Marathi population, while disparaging outsiders. His Shiv Sena cadres were often toughs and roughnecks; an official inquiry blamed Mr. Thackeray and his supporters for provoking riots that broke out in 1992 and led to the deaths of about 1,000 people, most of them Muslims. No official action was ever taken against him. His funeral rites and public cremation ceremony were attended by tens of thousands of people, including movie stars and some of the country\u2019s leading politicians. While some Indian newspapers carried critical commentaries of Mr. Thackeray\u2019s career, much of the nonstop weekend coverage on India\u2019s television news channels was far tamer, in some cases adulatory. Even former political enemies, perhaps not wishing to speak ill of the dead, offered praise. As for Ms. Dhada and Ms. Srinivasan, they were released on bail on Monday. The case has stirred so much condemnation that the top police official in Mumbai ordered an investigation into the arrests. For now, though, the two young women must await their first hearings in court.

Unhappy with the business's sagging performance, H.P. ousted the software company's mercurial Cambridge-educated founder and sent a team to England to review its books last May. It was then that a senior finance official at the British company stepped forward, raising questions about the accuracy of the numbers. Months of investigation followed, prompting Hewlett's accusations on Tuesday that the British software maker, Autonomy, had engaged in \"serious accounting improprieties.\" Before the deal, H.P. claimed, Autonomy inflated its sales. The problems went undetected by outside accountants - both Autonomy's auditors and a firm H.P. hired to vet the deal. The accounting issues at Autonomy, which sells software that examines data for patterns, cost Hewlett more than $5 billion. Now, the Autonomy matter has been referred to regulators in two countries, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened a case, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. H.P. is also considering its own legal action. \"This took time\" to uncover, said Meg Whitman, H.P.'s chief executive. The issues, she said, \"were designed to be hidden.\" Hewlett can't escape the onslaught of bad news. In recent years, what was once a giant of Silicon Valley has been buffeted by management turnover, board controversy and waning profits. The company, which previously rivaled the likes of I.B.M., Cisco and SAP, has watched the value of its stock erode sharply. Even before the accounting problems, the Autonomy acquisition looked troubled. Within weeks, the deal contributed to the downfall of the chief executive at H.P. and led to squabbles among company's directors, including Ms. Whitman, who took over in September 2011. In the latest quarter, the company reported a $6.9 billion loss, dragged down by the Autonomy mess and continuing problems in the business that resulted in an overall charge of $8.8 billion. On Tuesday, the stock continued falling, dropping 12 percent to less than $12, its lowest point since 2002. \"We intend to be very aggressive in recovering value for our shareholders,\" said John Schultz, H.P.'s chief counsel. Individuals will be examined as well as accounting firms, he said, adding, \"we're not limiting it to Autonomy.\" Autonomy's founder, Mike Lynch, rejected Hewlett-Packard's claims, denying that his former company committed any accounting chicanery or misled anyone about its financial information. He indicated that the company's practices were in line with international accounting standards. \"It's completely and utterly wrong,\" Mr. Lynch said. The deal was criticized at the outset. In August 2011, H.P.'s chief executive at the time, L\u00e9o Apotheker, shifted strategy unexpectedly. All in the same announcement, Mr. Apotheker disclosed plans to buy Autonomy, killed two major products and publicly mused about selling the company's personal computing business. While many Wall Street analysts said H.P. was overpaying for Autonomy, Mr. Apotheker believed that H.P., which sells printers and computer servers as well as PCs, needed to move more aggressively into software. In buying Autonomy, he was buying into one of the biggest trends in tech, the analysis of voluminous data. Autonomy specializes in finding patterns among so-called unstructured data, like e-mails, online video, or web surfing. Mr. Lynch is a Cambridge-trained Ph.D. in signal processing who previously founded a company that searched for fingerprint patterns. He made a reported $800 million from the sale of Autonomy. A brilliant man known for a brutish office manner, he bonded with Mr. Apotheker, a multilingual German software executive. But within weeks of striking the deal, Mr. Apotheker was out, and Ms. Whitman was named to the top spot. During the deal negotiations, she had complained about the Autonomy price to other board members, according to several people briefed on the matter. Mr. Lynch's other close ally at H.P. during the sale of Autonomy, a chief technology officer named Shane Robison, left H.P. toward the end of 2011. Early in her tenure, Ms. Whitman resolved to increase Autonomy's customer base with existing H.P. clients, and to look for ways to put the software inside H.P. products. Ms. Whitman and other executives gushed about the opportunities, describing ways Autonomy's number-crunching technology could take on I.B.M. in data analysis, and Amazon.com in cloud computing services. Behind the scenes, the situation was less sunny. After securing the deal, Mr. Lynch tried to keep Autonomy far from H.P.'s bureaucracy. He mostly worked in London, and initially kept Autonomy's main office in a San Francisco high-rise decorated with pictures of famous theoretical mathematicians, and not at H.P.'s Palo Alto headquarters."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/21\/technology\/european-governments-staying-out-of-the-cloud.html","body":"BERLIN \u2014 Providers of cloud services in Europe are having problems selling to some of their biggest potential customers: national governments.Concerns that data collected by government agencies could ultimately be sold to third parties has prompted some entities to postpone efforts to move their databases to the cloud, making Europe a far less promising market for such services than the United States. In October, the House of Lords in Britain delayed a plan to let government agencies combine their databases to improve voter registration rolls. Some had already moved data to the cloud, and mixing information with the cloud-based databases was considered too risky. \u201cIn the end, the House of Lords basically decided to take a go-slow approach,\u201d said Lord Reid, a member of the chamber. The fears may be well-founded. According to SafeGov, a Washington-based group that advises governments on cloud services, the privacy policies of companies like Microsoft and Google do not precisely lay out how they would protect government data from being sifted for information on individuals, which is particularly valuable to advertisers and other marketers. SafeGov is urging both companies to pledge publicly not to mine government data and to include clauses binding them to that promise in their contracts. Microsoft and Google, in statements, insist they have done so, but questions persist. \u201cWe have spent a lot of time looking at the privacy policies of the cloud providers in the public sector,\u201d said Jeff Gould, an expert for SafeGov and the chief executive and research director of Peerstone Group, an information technology consultancy. \u201cOur conclusion is that some of them have policies that whether by design or accident, allow them to conduct data mining of user information for purposes not related to the public-sector mission.\u201d That uncertainly has some European governments seeking extra assurance before moving their data onto the cloud. In September, the Norwegian data protection regulator, Datatilsynet, allowed two cities, Narvik and Moss, to use Google Apps and Microsoft\u2019s Office 365, but only if the companies stipulated they would refrain from mining data. The towns must also arrange independent audits to ensure that the information is handled properly. In the United States, a range of American companies, including Lockheed Martin, I.B.M., Oracle, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Google, Amazon.com and Microsoft, are now serving government agencies. The U.S. government will spend $4.7 billion on cloud computing services and associated infrastructure in 2013, according to Market Research Media, which is based in San Francisco. By 2018, annual spending on cloud services will grow to $10 billion, or about 11 percent of U.S. government spending on information technology, the firm estimates. Breaking into the government market is \u201ca dream\u201d of any information technology firm, said Daniel Miller, an analyst with Market Research Media. \u201cMicrosoft and Amazon are there with just a tip of one leg. Google is only making inroads. Why would these companies compromise years of hard work for some mythical and doubtful mining benefits?\u201d Concerns in Europe over the sanctity of public data in the cloud surfaced in October after the data protection regulator in France, CNIL, criticized what it said were inadequacies in Google\u2019s privacy policy. The agency criticized Google\u2019s practice of tying together data on individuals from across its services, which the regulator said could be mined for commercial purposes. Google has said its policy conforms to European law. But the regulator\u2019s warning will put skittish European governments even more on edge, said Lord Reid, who served as Britain\u2019s home, defense and Northern Ireland secretaries under Prime Minister Tony Blair. Lord Reid is also a principal for the Chertoff Group, a Washington-based consulting firm set up by the former U.S. secretary of homeland security, Michael Chertoff. \u201cI think there has been a recognition that the cloud offers great efficiencies,\u201d Lord Reid said. \u201cThere has also been an awareness of the vulnerabilities and potential misuses.\u201d 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/21\/business\/year-end-fiscal-debate-is-chance-to-address-inequality.html","body":"To judge by the newfound bipartisan chumminess exhibited last week, it seems suddenly possible that the president and Republican leaders will reach a deal before the end of the year to cut spending, raise taxes and prevent the country from toppling over the fiscal cliff and back into recession.They may even achieve the long-sought Grand Bargain to trim $4 trillion from the budget deficit over the next decade, a surprisingly positive outcome to the long standoff between the White House and Congressional Republicans. But as our leaders begin to bargain, they may want to stop and reflect on what\u2019s missing from their conversation. Consumed by the question of how big a government we can afford, they might want to give some thought to a more relevant consideration: How big a government do we need? \u201cThat\u2019s a question that we rarely have the luxury to address,\u201d said Alan Auerbach, an expert on public finance at the University of California, Berkeley. In the spirit of turning a crisis into an opportunity, this is perhaps an appropriate question to ask now. The American economy is facing enormous challenges, buffeted by the relentless tide of globalization and technological change and burdened by a rapidly aging population. To a large extent, our future well-being will depend on how the government responds, to what extent it cushions the blow for the most vulnerable and whether it helps workers adapt or leaves them to their own devices. Two related numbers capture the nature of our economic challenge: one is $3,837, which is how much the annual income of the typical middle-class family shrank from 2000 to 2010. The other is 17.42 percent, the slice of national income captured in 2010 by the richest 1 percent of the population. That is more than twice the share they reaped 30 years before. We do not fully understand the economic forces that have concentrated so much of the fruits of growth among such a tiny sliver of the population. What seems certain is that most of these forces will continue to play a big role in our future. Globalization will keep the pressure on workers in manufacturing industries, putting them in direct competition with cheap labor in China and other developing countries. Technological advances will continue to replace manufacturing and clerical jobs \u2014 in effect, changing the skill set required of the American labor force. The best-educated and best-connected Americans are likely to continue drawing the vast majority of the rewards created by the new technologies and the financial wizardry in the vast markets opened by globalization. This lopsided pattern of development is hurting us, many economists believe. It is undercutting the aspiration that every American should have a fair shot at progress. There is mounting evidence that our vast inequalities may breed instability and blunt the nation\u2019s economic growth. There are things the government could do to help us deal with these growing inequities, spreading the bounty of the global economy more broadly and cushioning American workers from its blows. But that might require the government to be substantially bigger \u2014 and taxes substantially higher \u2014 than we have tolerated in the past. President Obama\u2019s health care law was a step in this direction, ensuring that workers who lose their job do not lose their health care, too. There is more that can be done to build a broader and more robust safety net. Some economists, for instance, suggest adding some form of wage subsidy or insurance to encourage employment and protect the income of displaced workers forced to take a lower-paying job. The government could also invest more heavily in education. American 15-year-olds ranked in 22nd place in reading literacy, 21st place in science and 29th place in math in international tests coordinated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. And the United States dropped precipitously in the organization\u2019s international rankings of college graduation rates. Robert Reich, a political economist at Berkeley who served as labor secretary in Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, suggests increasing the mandatory education to 14 years, including two years of universal community college to equip workers with the new skills required by a changing economy. Many economists recommend that the government support continual training, which companies are reluctant to engage in lest newly trained workers be poached by competitors. Government can play a role fostering the well-paid jobs that will support the middle class of the future. Lawrence Katz, a professor of economics at Harvard, suggests that the government use the leverage of Medicare to encourage hospitals and nursing homes to employ well-paid, highly trained nurses and aides. Robert Frank, an economics professor at Cornell, adds that renewal of the nation\u2019s dilapidated infrastructure is an obvious place to look for good jobs. To the extent that the hypercompetitive global economy condemns a larger share of the American labor force to low-end service jobs, the government may have to provide more direct support. N. Gregory Mankiw a professor of economics at Harvard who headed the Council of Economic Advisers during the administration of George W. Bush, frames our choice succinctly. \u201cIf we want a robust social safety net along the lines of many Western European countries, we will eventually need taxes on the middle class similar to what you see in many of those countries,\u201d Mr. Mankiw wrote in an e-mail. \u201cIf that tax burden is deemed unacceptable, then the American people will have to rethink the social safety net.\u201d So far, the debate in Washington has focused on only one side of the proposition. From the abortive deal negotiated between President Obama and Speaker John Boehner last year, which was dropped in the face of conservative opposition, to the plan proposed earlier this year by Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee and former Republican vice-presidential candidate, every fiscal reform plan assumes that government spending on entitlements and other programs must be cut. But that is not the only way to think about our conundrum. For instance, Bruce Bartlett, a tax expert who worked in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, argues that raising federal tax revenue to about 22 percent of the nation\u2019s economic output would go a long way to protect many of our entitlement programs. Twenty-two percent of our gross domestic product might be more than we have ever paid in federal taxes. It is much higher than the historical average of 18.5 percent. But this amount is still well below the levels of the more generous social democracies in Europe. And we can afford them. \u201cGlobalization creates winners and losers,\u201d Mr. Reich said. \u201cBut the winners can compensate the losers and still be ahead.\u201d It is not too late to take our focus off shrinking the safety net we have now to debate how we can pay for an adequate one.

Those agencies have come under fire for failing to warn of the financial crisis and overlooking huge risks in the debt market, including loans for subprime real estate as well as the Greek government\u2019s debt pile. The agencies usually get their funding from the creditors whose debt they assess. In the case of sovereign debt, the agencies have been accused of timidity for fear of provoking officials whose governments would probably have to pay higher borrowing costs. French officials played down the Moody\u2019s decision, issued late Monday, and sought to blame the country\u2019s previous rightist governments for the economic challenges. \u201cThis rating change doesn\u2019t call into question either our economic fundamentals or the reforms engaged in by the government, nor the high standard of our credit,\u201d Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici said at a news conference. The downgrade, he added, \u201cis punishment for the situation we have inherited, which hasn\u2019t stopped deteriorating for 10 years.\u201d President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a Socialist, took office in May. For the previous decade, France was led by Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy, both from the right. Incra is an attempt by the Bertelsmann Foundation, financed by a German media conglomerate, to show how a ratings agency could be structured without the potential conflicts of interest the commercial agencies face. The European Commission has stepped up regulation of ratings agencies while also requiring banks and bond funds to take more responsibility for analyzing the creditworthiness of the governments and companies they invest in. There has also been talk of creating a European credit ratings agency. Annette Heuser, executive director of the Bertelsmann Foundation in Washington, said the organization hoped that the Group of 20 countries, which have also expressed concern about the current debt rating system, would take the lead in creating a nonprofit ratings agency. \u201cWe need an international solution that brings in the emerging economies,\u201d Ms. Heuser said. It was the first report on France by Incra, so there were no previous ratings to compare to. The agency gave France a score of 7.9 out of 10, or AA+. Incra had given Germany a rating of 8.1, or AAA\u2013; and 7.2 for Italy, or AA\u2013. On Tuesday, Incra also rated Brazil, which received a score of 6.8, or A+; and Japan, which received a score of 6.0, or A\u2013, because of its high debt and stagnant economy. Incra cited what it said was France\u2019s slow growth, heavily regulated labor market and a pension system that could become unaffordable over time. France could also be required to help pay for the bailout of other euro zone countries as well as its own banks, Incra said. Moody\u2019s cited some of the same factors in its decision to downgrade France. But Ms. Heuser said that Incra\u2019s methodology looked not only at economic data but also at indicators of how well society functions, including the efficiency of the court system and the level of corruption. \u201cEven if we come to a similar conclusion, the underlying analysis is completely different,\u201d Ms. Heuser said. She said that Incra also believed that the French educational system had been declining, which hurt the country\u2019s score. In its decision to downgrade French debt, Moody\u2019s cited a worse outlook for government finances as a result of France\u2019s fading competitiveness and \u201cthe longstanding rigidities of its labor, goods and service markets.\u201d It also warned that the country\u2019s resilience to shocks from the euro crisis was declining. At the same time, Moody\u2019s said, France faces greater fiscal obligations from developments including the bailouts of other euro zone countries. Moody\u2019s decision came as no surprise, as Standard & Poor\u2019s had stripped France of its triple-A rating in January. The French economy has stagnated for most of this year, growing just 0.2 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter. The euro zone as a whole has fallen back into recession. Fitch still rates France as AAA, and Mr. Moscovici pointed out that investors had largely ignored the S.&P. downgrade: the country\u2019s borrowing costs remain near record lows. The United States, which lost its triple-A rating from S.&P. in August 2011, has also been able to borrow at historically low rates.

One of the draft decrees adopted calls for tougher supervision of spending by ministries and state enterprises. It also requires that money raised from the privatization of state assets is paid directly into an escrow account held by the Greek central bank to ensure the funds go toward paying off state debt. The account was set up in March under the terms of Greece\u2019s second international bailout. The decrees, a type of emergency measure that does not require parliamentary approval, come a little more than a week after the government approved a new raft of \u20ac17 billion in austerity measures and overhauls to be carried out over the next four years. State workers, who have vowed to overturn some of those overhauls, including plans to push 2,000 employees into a fast-track layoff program this year, continued to stage sit-ins at hundreds of city halls and municipal offices across the country on Monday. Despite the upheaval, the authorities remain focused on pushing through measures intended to secure the release of more than \u20ac30 billion in fresh rescue loans that Greece needs to avoid default. Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said late Sunday that Athens had done its bit. \u201cWe are fully ready for Tuesday,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no outstanding issues on our side.\u201d Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, who is struggling to hold together an increasingly fragile coalition, hopes that a final push by Athens to tie up loose ends may lead to movement on the release of the aid and on the financing of a two-year extension to the country\u2019s fiscal adjustment period. But the outlook for both is unclear due to differences between euro zone and International Monetary Fund officials on how to make Greece\u2019s huge debt burden manageable. The I.M.F., along with the European Commission and the European Central Bank, make up the troika of lenders that have demanded a set of stringent measures from the government in Athens in exchange for two bailouts totaling \u20ac250 billion. One of the decrees approved Monday grants the Finance Ministry greater powers to oversee other ministries and calls for the appointment of inspectors to monitor spending at departments that fail to meet their fiscal targets for two consecutive quarters. Top officials whose department miss their targets face the prospect of having their salary cut or being laid off. Local agencies that fail to get their finances in order must raise additional tax revenue to meet their goals. The first decree also calls for revenue from privatization projects to be paid into a special escrow account at Greece\u2019s central bank to ensure the funds go toward paying off state debt. A second decree sets out cuts to the salaries and pensions of parliamentary employees who, with bonuses, earn the equivalent of up to 16 monthly salaries annually. That would bring their pay into line with that of other civil servants."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/20\/business\/global\/cash-short-europe-takes-aim-at-the-moon.html","body":"PARIS \u2014 Forty years after humans last walked on the Moon, Europe\u2019s space industry is hoping to play a key role in the resumption of manned lunar exploration planned for later this decade. But whether cash-strapped governments are prepared to pay for out-of-this-world projects remains unclear. Science ministers from the 20 member states of the European Space Agency gather Tuesday in Naples for a two-day meeting where they will be asked to approve a budget of up to \u20ac12 billion, or $15.3 billion, for the next three years that would include financing for dozens of programs, including a new lunar crew transport vehicle, at least two Mars exploration missions and a successor to Europe\u2019s highly successful Ariane 5 rocket. By comparison, the U.S. space agency, NASA, had a budget of $18 billion for the 2012 fiscal year. \u201cI am not living on a different planet,\u201d Jean-Jacques Dordain, the E.S.A.\u2019s director general, said in an interview at the agency\u2019s headquarters here. \u201cI know the difficulties of people. I read the newspapers. The economic situation will have an impact.\u201d Until the global economic crisis struck four years ago, the E.S.A. had been able to count on steady increases to its annual budget, which today stands at just over \u20ac4 billion. But industry executives predict that the fiscal and deficit pact forged this year to save the euro will most likely require several member states to reduce their financing of space programs. Mr. Dordain said he hoped the ministers in Naples would approve a budget of at least \u20ac10 billion through 2015 \u2014 an average of \u20ac3.3 billion a year. The E.S.A.\u2019s origins date from the late 1960s as the European countries with significant space expertise \u2014 particularly Britain, France, Germany and Italy \u2014 began to fear being left behind as the United States and Soviet Union channeled enormous financial and technological resources into their Cold War space race. The agency receives three-fourths of its budget directly from member states and the rest from the European Union and a handful of cooperating states. In Europe, more than 30,000 people are directly employed by the space industry and a further 300,000 people work in space-related sectors like satellite operations and an array of navigation, communications and Earth observation services. Part of Mr. Dordain\u2019s mission this week will be to reassure governments that the often high upfront costs of the E.S.A.\u2019s projects, which focus heavily on developing and launching satellites for earth observation and telecommunications, deliver tangible gains for European businesses. The European Union estimates, for example, that the \u20ac5 billion Galileo satellite navigation system \u2014 a competitor to the Global Positioning System of the United States \u2014 will generate \u20ac90 billion in economic benefits over the next 20 years. European companies have a 40 percent share of the global market in commercial satellite launchings, and economists say the revenue they generate is roughly 20 times the cost of the launchings themselves. Space investment, Mr. Dordain said, \u201cis not the man on the moon \u2014 it is down to earth.\u201d While the E.S.A. has always made its main priority the pursuit of knowledge about the Earth and the solar system, the current crisis has added another: leveraging space investments to enhance the competitiveness of European companies. It is a message, he said, that some European governments are coming to grasp. This month, Britain\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, announced plans to increase London\u2019s contribution to the E.S.A.\u2019s budget by 25 percent over the next two years. The larger contribution is expected to translate into more research contracts for British companies, the fruits of which could be commercialized into new products and services. Even the most audacious space-exploration missions have yielded technologies that have later found earthbound applications in areas like mobile communications, optics, robotics, energy generation and propulsion systems. That remains the main argument for continued European participation in projects like the International Space Station and forthcoming missions to the Moon, Mars and Mercury. Perhaps the most ambitious project on Mr. Dordain\u2019s wish list is a \u20ac450 million proposal to build, together with NASA, a space vehicle that would transport up to four astronauts on missions as long as six months. Its first mission, envisioned for around 2020, would bring the first humans to the Moon since the U.S. Apollo space program ended in 1972. The spacecraft could be modified in later years for manned missions to Mars or one of the asteroids. Other proposals on the table this week include \u20ac100 million to finance the first phase of development for a robotic lander that would explore the Moon\u2019s south pole, which some scientists believe may harbor ancient deposits of ice. An initial feasibility study for the lander was awarded in 2010 to Astrium, a unit of European Aeronautic Defense & Space. \u201cI have more ideas than member states have money,\u201d Mr. Dordain said. A rocket scientist who has trained as an astronaut, Mr. Dordain, 66, was in primary school when the Soviet Union lofted Sputnik in 1957. He earned his engineering degree on July 20, 1969, the day Neil Armstrong walked on the Moon. While he continues to press the case for space investment to European leaders, he concedes that it is impossible to put a price tag on the thrill of exploration that inspired his own career \u2014 and that the E.S.A. aims to harness by encouraging young Europeans to become scientists and engineers. \u201cYou cannot put an economic value on providing dreams,\u201d he said."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/20\/world\/asia\/new-communist-party-chief-in-china-denounces-corruption.html","body":"BEIJING \u2014 In his first speech to the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s elite Politburo, Xi Jinping, the new party chief, denounced the prevalence of corruption and said officials needed to guard against its spread or it would \u201cdoom the party and the state.\u201dThe blunt remarks by Mr. Xi were made Saturday at a meeting of the 25-person Politburo, which announced a turnover of 15 members last week during the change in leadership at the close of the 18th Party Congress, the state news media reported on Monday. Mr. Xi\u2019s admonitions suggested that he wanted to take a populist tack in shaping his image, but they were also consistent with warnings that Chinese leaders have delivered in recent years and echoed points he made in his inaugural speech on Thursday. Corruption is one of the issues of greatest concern to Chinese, and Mr. Xi even obliquely referred to the problem in Arab countries and the revolutions there. \u201cIn recent years, the long pent-up problems in some countries have led to the venting of public outrage, to social turmoil and to the fall of governments, and corruption and graft have been an important reason,\u201d Mr. Xi said, according to a version of the speech posted online. \u201cA mass of facts tells us that if corruption becomes increasingly serious, it will inevitably doom the party and the state. We must be vigilant. In recent years, there have been cases of grave violations of disciplinary rules and laws within the party that have been extremely malign in nature and utterly destructive politically, shocking people to the core.\u201d Mr. Xi used a Chinese aphorism \u2014 \u201cworms come only after matter decays\u201d \u2014 to stress his point. The phrase is often attributed to Su Shi, a scholar of the Northern Song dynasty, and it was cited on several recent occasions by Bo Xilai, the disgraced former party chief of Chongqing, who was felled last spring by a murder scandal and is expected to stand trial soon on criminal charges related to abuse of power. When Mr. Bo used the phrase in speeches, it was also in the context of denouncing corruption and enhancing his populist image. Ironically, Mr. Xi\u2019s allusion to recent \u201cgrave violations\u201d of party discipline appeared to refer in part to Mr. Bo. Both Mr. Xi and Mr. Bo are sons of powerful Communist leaders, and Mr. Bo, a former Politburo member, was seen as a rival to Mr. Xi. Mr. Xi also took the occasion on Saturday to underscore the need to remain true to the party\u2019s founding ideology, and warned that some officials appeared to be heading down a wayward path in this area, too. \u201cFaith in Marxism and a belief in socialism and communism is the political soul of a Communist and the spiritual pillar that allows a Communist to withstand any test,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cTo put it more vividly, ideals and convictions are the spiritual calcium of Communists, and if these ideals and convictions are missing or irresolute, then there is a lack of spiritual calcium that leads to soft bones.\u201d A series of scandals and revelations this year have undermined confidence in China\u2019s leaders and cast greater scrutiny on the prevalence of nepotism and patronage at the top ranks of the party. All that comes at a time when influential voices are rising inside China calling for fundamental changes to the political and economic systems. The Bo Xilai scandal attracted widespread attention last spring inside China and abroad. Then Bloomberg News reported that the relatives of Mr. Xi held investments and assets worth at least hundreds of millions of dollars, and The New York Times published the results of a yearlong investigation that found the family of Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, held investments and assets worth at least $2.7 billion. The Web sites of both news organizations were blocked in China around the time the articles were published. Pu Zhiqiang, a rights lawyer, said in an interview on Monday that \u201cevery generation of leaders has mentioned\u201d corruption upon taking office. \u201cNo one would neglect paying attention to the problem of corruption,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s common sense. The crux of the matter is how to implement anti-corruption measures.\u201d On Thursday, the party announced that the new head of its anti-corruption agency, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, would be Wang Qishan, a former vice premier with deep experience in the finance sector. Mr. Wang is now the sixth-ranking party official and is on the seven-man Standing Committee of the Politburo. (In other important appointments, the party announced Monday that Meng Jianzhu, a Politburo member, will take charge of the party\u2019s Central Politics and Law Commission, which oversees security and the courts and was previously run by a Standing Committee member, the much-disliked Zhou Yongkang; and Zhao Leji, also on the Politburo, will be the head of the Organization Department, which oversees personnel issues.) There are those who say that relying on the anti-corruption commission and a nontransparent process to ferret out and punish offending officials is not the right way to set the party straight. At a seminar in Beijing on Friday that was attended by liberal scholars and intellectuals, Chen Youxi, a prominent lawyer and former official, emphasized that point. \u201cOur present approach to fighting corruption basically has increasingly relied on turning the legal authorities into party authorities, strengthening the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and using party oversight against corruption,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think this is a dead end. The more powerful the Discipline Inspection Commission has become, the more serious corruption has become, because if you depend on secretively fighting corruption, you only encourage more corruption.\u201d Patrick Zuo contributed research."},{"url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9903E4D91438F933A15752C1A9649D8B63","body":"6:43 p.m. | Updated Pushed by a bankruptcy judge eager to save thousands of jobs, Hostess Brands and one of its biggest unions agreed to mediation on Monday, in a last-ditch effort to avoid winding down Hostess, the bankrupt maker of Twinkies and Wonder Bread. At the behest of the judge, Hostess Brands and the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Union, which represents 5,600 Hostess workers, will meet with a mediator on Tuesday to try to narrow their differences toward a labor agreement. If the mediation succeeds, it could prevent the liquidation of the company and save 18,500 jobs. Otherwise, Hostess is likely to auction off its well-known brands, leaving the fates of those workers in limbo. In January, Hostess, an 82-year-old company, filed for Chapter 11, just three years after emerging from bankruptcy. At the time, the company said it was unable to pay its debts and needed to make deep cuts in labor costs to survive. Hostess was able to reach a new contract with the Teamsters, its largest union. But talks between the company and the bakery workers deadlocked, and the union went on strike on Nov. 9. With production slowing and its finances dwindling, the company announced plans on Friday to liquidate. Judge Robert D. Drain of the Federal Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York pushed hard for the two sides to try one last round of talks. The judge expressed worry that neither side had exhausted all efforts to avoid liquidation. He especially urged the bakery union to seek mediation, suggesting that it might face significant legal claims if Hostess is forced to liquidate. \"I'm giving the union, as well as the debtor and their lenders, a chance to work out their issues in private,\" Judge Drain said. \"If they don't take it, it's not that the issues won't be worked out. They will, but it will be done in public and in an expensive way.\" The unions have been at the center of the struggle for Hostess's survival. When Hostess filed for bankruptcy, the company insisted that its labor costs and union rules were unsustainable, and it moved to renegotiate the contracts. One work rule required that two separate trucks be used to ship bread and cake products to a single retailer. The company also indicated that it faced $52 million in workers' compensation claims. The two main unions, the bakery workers and Teamsters, countered that years of mismanagement were to blame. The private equity backers had loaded the company with debt, the unions said, making it difficult to modernize Hostess's bakeries or product offerings. The bakery workers' president, Frank Hurt, called the private equity owners \"vulture capitalists.\" The two unions took different approaches to the labor negotiations. The Teamsters hired a financial consultant, Harry J. Wilson, who had worked on the General Motors restructuring. He laid out just how much the union could get and still allow for a recovery of the company. \"We're pragmatic when it comes to this situation,\" said Ken Hall, the Teamsters' secretary-treasurer. \"We know that it's a tough situation. We knew that because of mismanagement, the company was in a real hole.\" After eight months, the Teamsters eventually reached an agreement with the company. The union agreed to a contract that cut pay by 8 percent immediately - with that cut shrinking to 5 percent next year. The Teamster workers, most of whom drive trucks for Hostess, average about $20 an hour; the bakery union workers, $16 an hour. The Teamsters contract reduced the company's health contributions by 17 percent and suspended its pension contributions until 2015. The company had originally insisted on freezing the pension plan permanently and ceasing all contributions. The Teamsters insisted on numerous concessions from management. The company eventually agreed to give Hostess's unions two seats on its board, a 25 percent share of company stock and a $100 million claim in bankruptcy. Last March, the Teamsters helped push out Hostess's former chief executive after the board proposed tripling his salary even as he was demanding steep concessions from the workers. In September, the Teamsters members voted narrowly to approve the deal, 53 percent to 47 percent. The bakery workers union took a far more adversarial stance. After Hostess's unions had agreed to more than $100 million in annual cost concessions during Hostess's previous bankruptcy, the bakery union thought it made little sense to agree to further cuts. It feared a deal would pull down wages and benefits throughout the industry, without saving Hostess. \"Our consultant said the debt load on the company was too heavy, and that we would be back in bankruptcy and facing liquidation in 12 to 16 months from now, even if we took more concessions,\" David B. Durkee, the union's secretary-treasurer, said. The bakery union often derided Hostess's management, saying it was composed of Wall Street investors and \"third-tier managers\" from nonbaking companies. It said the investors were trying to \"resolve the mess by attacking the company's most valuable asset - its workers.\" Both sides refused to budge, and the bakery union went on strike at 24 of the company's 33 bakeries. With the threat of liquidation looming, the Teamsters, in an unusual move, called on the bakery workers to hold a vote to determine whether the rank-and-file workers wanted to end their strike and accept Hostess's offer - or face layoffs. Last Thursday, Mr. Hall of the Teamsters told the bakery workers that Teamsters members could not believe liquidation and layoffs were what the bakery workers \"ultimately wanted to accomplish when they went out on strike.\" But the bakery union declined to hold such a vote. The next day, the company announced plans to liquidate and sell off its assets. \"There was this whole theory that the company was bluffing about liquidation and there was some white knight that was going to come and buy the company\" Mr. Hall said. Now, Hostess and the bakery union will meet at the offices of the company's lawyers. Representatives for the Teamsters and the company's bankruptcy lenders were also invited to attend. If the two sides cannot agree, Hostess's lawyers are expected to appear in court on Wednesday morning to seek approval of their liquidation plan. Potential suitors are already lining up. Some of Hostess's rivals may pursue deals for the company's most popular brands, especially Twinkies. One possible buyer, Flowers Foods, disclosed on Monday that recent revisions to its bank lending agreements would allow the bakery company to borrow up to $700 million. That additional cash may help finance a deal, analysts said. A spokesman for Flowers did not return a call for comment. Industry analysts say Grupo Bimbo, the world's largest bread-baking company, is also in the mix. Bimbo, which already owns parts of Entenmann's, Thomas' English muffins and Sara Lee bakery, made - and then withdrew - a $540 million bid for Hostess during its previous bankruptcy. The company might just buy pieces, because it could face antitrust issues. Financial investors like Sun Capital Partners and Metropoulos & Company have also said that they are interested in pursuing a deal for Hostess. Sun's co-chief executive, Marc Leder, told Fortune, \"I think that we could offer a slightly better, more labor-friendly deal than what was on the table last week.\" This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Financed by huge loans from state-owned banks, the district is an immense public works project, and is closely associated with Zhang Gaoli, the little-known Communist Party secretary of Tianjin who joined the new seven-member Politburo Standing Committee last week at the end of the 18th Party Congress. Mr. Zhang has emerged as the man expected, after approval by the National People\u2019s Congress in March, to handle day-to-day management of the Chinese economy. He won out over Wang Qishan, who has a much deeper background in economic and financial policy making and was seen as likely to clash with and perhaps even overshadow the incoming prime minister, Li Keqiang. Chinese leaders have not forgotten how Zhu Rongji, with a similarly deep background, managed to dominate economic policy making from his position as executive vice premier in the mid-1990s. As the Yujiapu project makes clear, Mr. Zhang has been a defender of huge government-guided investments, an approach that very much fits the mold of ambitious party officials eager to get ahead within the existing power structure. At the same time, say experts and people who know him, he has cultivated an image as a stern bureaucratic taskmaster, a politician who can get things done by working with powerful business interests rather than challenging them. \u201cHe\u2019s a very strong guy,\u201d said Jean-Luc Charles, the general manager of Airbus\u2019s assembly plant here for the A320 jetliner, who had nothing but praise for Mr. Zhang. \u201cHe sets a target and people run.\u201d But Mr. Zhang also has some surprising characteristics. In Tianjin, he has pushed to expand retailing and other services as a way to create jobs beyond construction and manufacturing. He also is an advocate for firm environmental and labor standards aimed at improving the lives of ordinary Chinese. After a series of increases during Mr. Zhang\u2019s tenure, the city\u2019s minimum wage is now 4 percent higher than Beijing\u2019s \u2014 even though Tianjin is considerably poorer over all. And while Tianjin cracked down on labor protests in the summer of 2010, the municipal authorities have since set up a trade union for migrant workers, who usually have few legal protections. The migrant workers\u2019 union \u201cnegotiated a reasonable deal for sanitation workers in the city,\u201d said Geoffrey Crothall, the spokesman for China Labor Bulletin, a nonprofit group in Hong Kong that favors the establishment of independent unions in China. Tianjin residents described two street protests here in April, one against a $1.7 billion expansion project at a chemical plant and the other against a real estate developer who was accused of absconding with apartment buyers\u2019 deposits. The authorities were quick to negotiate compromises in both cases, suspending construction at the chemical plant, even though it was being built by Sinopec, one of the largest state-owned enterprises, while tracking down the developer and requiring restitution. They did not resort to calling riot police to disperse the protesters, as municipal leaders have sometimes done elsewhere in China, residents said. Tianjin has adopted many Western pollution regulations and in some cases tightened them further. Air and water emissions from the Airbus factory here are monitored by pollution equipment that is connected around the clock to government monitoring computers. It is not clear, though, whether these policies reflect a personal commitment by Mr. Zhang to progressive social policies or his penchant for setting rules and making sure people follow them. Perhaps both. \u201cZhang is very strong with all the regulations \u2014 do it in accordance with the regulations and no joke,\u201d Mr. Charles said. Mayor Huang Xingguo of Tianjin, the second-ranking official in this city of 13 million after Mr. Zhang, cited the city\u2019s many parks and its air quality \u2014 though by some estimates it is only marginally better than Beijing\u2019s \u2014 at a news conference in Beijing late last week during the party congress. At the same time, he added a commercial note that captures the tone of the city\u2019s administration: \u201cWe hope you come to Tianjin to buy houses.\u201d 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/20\/science\/creating-a-balloonlike-plug-to-hold-back-floodwaters.html","body":"MORGANTOWN, W.Va. \u2014 With a few dull thuds, the one-ton bag of high-strength fabric tumbled from the wall of the mock subway tunnel and onto the floor. Then it began to grow.As air flowed into it through a hose, the bundle inflated until it was crammed tight inside the 16-foot-diameter tunnel, looking like the filling in a giant concrete-and-steel cannoli. The three-minute procedure, conducted on a chilly morning this month in an airport hangar not far from West Virginia University, was the latest test of a device that may someday help guard real tunnels during disasters \u2014 whether a terrorist strike or a storm like Hurricane Sandy, whose wind-driven surge of water overwhelmed New York City\u2019s subway system, shutting it down for days. \u201cThe goal is to provide flooding protection for transportation tunnels,\u201d said John Fortune, who is managing the project for the federal Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Science and Technology Directorate. The idea is a simple one: rather than retrofitting tunnels with metal floodgates or other expensive structures, the project aims to use a relatively cheap inflatable plug to hold back floodwaters. In theory, it would be like blowing up a balloon inside a tube. But in practice, developing a plug that is strong, durable, quick to install and foolproof to deploy is a difficult engineering task, one made even more challenging because of the pliable, relatively lightweight materials required. \u201cWater is heavy, there\u2019s a lot of pressure,\u201d said Greg Holter, an engineer with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory who helps manage the project. \u201cSo it\u2019s not as simple as just inflating and filling the space. The plug has to be able to withstand the pressure of the water behind it.\u201d The idea has been in development for more than five years \u2014 this test was the 21st \u2014 and Dr. Fortune says there are at least a few more years of testing and design work ahead. If the plugs are shown to be effective, they will be made available to transit systems around the country; at least initially, they are expected to cost about $400,000 each. \u201cWe have frequent conversations with folks in mass transit agencies, the true experts in the field, on how this would be deployed,\u201d Dr. Fortune said, although he declined to name specific agencies, citing the antiterrorism aspect of the project. Adam Lisberg, the chief spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs New York City\u2019s transit systems, said the damage caused by the storm \u201cis certainly going to focus our attention\u201d on ways to protect the subways. \u201cBut it\u2019s way too early to talk about any particular technology that\u2019s been proposed,\u201d he said. In all, seven of the city\u2019s 14 under-river subway tunnels were flooded during the storm, as were several major highway tunnels. Dr. Fortune said that plugs might work for highway tunnels, too, but that the larger size of those tunnels created additional technical challenges that would have to be overcome. Work on the plug began in 2007, after Ever J. Barbero, a West Virginia professor whose specialty is the use of advanced materials in engineering, was contacted by a Homeland Security official looking for outside-the-box ideas on ways to keep a subway system from flooding if an underwater tunnel were breached \u2014 by a terrorist bomb, for example. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about this,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I found out what happened in Chicago.\u201d Dr. Barbero was referring to a 1992 episode in which an abandoned freight tunnel under the Chicago River was breached by a crew sinking bridge pilings. That led to a flood that caused close to $2 billion in damage to downtown buildings as the water spread underground. Dr. Barbero came up with an idea and shared it with Homeland Security officials. \u201cI said, \u2018We\u2019ll put an air bag in a tunnel,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he recalled. The department was intrigued \u2014 officials were familiar with European efforts to develop plugs to seal tunnels from gas and smoke after a series of deadly tunnel fires \u2014 and decided to finance the project. About $8 million has been spent so far. Dr. Barbero realized that the forces exerted on the pressurized plug, and the need to rely on friction against the tunnel walls to keep it in place under the onslaught of floodwaters, meant that it had to be made from very tough materials. Experts from ILC Dover, a company in Delaware that makes high-strength soft structures like spacesuits and the force-absorbing air bags used for some of the Mars rover landings, suggested fabric made from Vectran, a strong but lightweight yarn spun from a liquid-crystal polymer. But the first full-scale plug, made with a single layer of Vectran, failed during a pressure test in 2010. \u201cIt ripped right down the middle, from back to front,\u201d Dr. Fortune said. So Dr. Barbero and ILC came up with a three-layer plug, with the outer layer consisting of woven Vectran belts. It is designed so that the tearing of one belt will not cause a catastrophic failure. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/20\/nyregion\/fire-island-is-relieved-but-more-vulnerable-after-hurricane-sandy.html","body":"FIRE ISLAND, N.Y. \u2014 Dawn and David Cloutier knew the damage to their weekend house was bad when they spotted their teakettle, blocks away, in a ball field near the bay. Then they saw their outdoor shower enclosure wedged against a neighbor\u2019s house, and finally, their living room sofa, under some pines in their backyard.\u201cThe good thing is that we always wanted a tree in the living room,\u201d Mr. Cloutier said last week, mustering some black humor as he visited the house, in the island\u2019s Ocean Bay Park section, for the first time since Hurricane Sandy hit. \u201cNow we have our living room under the tree.\u201d Initial reports of the storm\u2019s impact on Fire Island were dire. And while it did breach the 32-mile island in two places, flood many of the 17 communities \u2014 during the storm, the bay and the ocean met, subsuming much of the island under feet of water \u2014 and ruin dozens of oceanfront houses, the verdict now is that it could have been far worse. Unlike many of the hardest-hit areas, Fire Island had a robust system of dunes, ranging from 10 to 20 feet in height, that largely absorbed the ocean\u2019s wrath, saving the bulk of the island\u2019s 4,500 homes. The dunes were replenished only a few years ago, after many residents agreed to accept a new tax to help finance the work. Now the dunes are gone. \u201cThe dunes served their purpose,\u201d said Steven Jaffe, president of the Ocean Bay Park Association, one of the homeowner groups on the island. \u201cBut they were decimated, and now we have a winter coming and we don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d Fearful of facing the next big storm without the protection of the dunes, some community associations are already reviving them, filling government-sanctioned bags, known as Geocubes, with sand, and building a tight wall where the dunes once stood. They are also scooping up the mounds of sand that washed onto walkways \u2014 the island is known for its paths and red wagons where others have roads and cars \u2014 and returning it to the dunes. But it will take the Army Corps of Engineers and federal money, residents say, to bring them all the way back to where they were. As they follow the debate that has erupted over the wisdom of rebuilding on storm-lashed beaches, community leaders are making the case that Fire Island is critical to Long Island\u2019s welfare. They cite one study suggesting that the island, with only a few thousand homes, and 200 year-round families, protects a stretch of the mainland with 13,000 homes and properties, valued at roughly $10 billion. \u201cWe\u2019re the first line of defense for Long Island, and the dunes are our first line of defense,\u201d said Suzy Goldhirsch, president of the Fire Island Association, an umbrella group of community associations. \u201cWe\u2019re self-reliant. We\u2019re island people. But we need support. \u201cWe won\u2019t ask for more than anyone else, but we don\u2019t want to be forgotten.\u201d About three-fourths of the island is undeveloped, including an eight-mile stretch of federal wilderness that is part of the Fire Island National Seashore. The dune system there was taller, with hills as high as 30 feet, and significantly wider than that of the residential areas. There were primary dunes and secondary dunes, with a dip in between. Chris Soller, superintendent of the Fire Island National Seashore, said the storm strafed a portion of the primary dunes, and 75 feet of depth were lost. The National Park Service, which oversees the seashore, will allow time and the tides to do their work on the federal lands and eventually rebuild the dunes. \u201cWe still have a lot of dune system left,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a storm that basically shifted the island. Maybe the dune line will not be in the same location, but we need to listen to nature.\u201d The breaches that the storm dug across the island are another matter. Each was in a nonresidential area. One bisected Smith Point County Park, toward Fire Island\u2019s eastern end, and on Monday, the Corps of Engineers began the process of filling it back in with dredged sand. The Park Service is taking a wait-and-see approach to the other breach, at Old Inlet, which has opened and closed on its own in the past. \u201cWe will evaluate it to see if it closes on its own,\u201d Mr. Soller said Friday. \u201cIt is starting to fill in. It could take weeks or months. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that there shouldn\u2019t be any new inlets.\u201d On Monday, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York called for the quick repair of the breach, saying it put the mainland at greater risk of flooding. The communities that sustained the most damage were Atlantique, Davis Park and Ocean Bay Park. Part of the challenge for Fire Island\u2019s private communities after the storm was the availability of labor, given the tiny off-season population of the island. With an evacuation order in place until recently, the restorative work of cleaning debris, buttressing the dunes and providing fire protection (on an island whose very name evokes that risk) was especially difficult. In Ocean Beach, which has the island\u2019s largest concentration of businesses, a fire broke out in a home on Halloween. One homeowner constructed a crow\u2019s nest on top of the tallest building in the area, a throwback to the fire towers of a predigital age. It has been staffed 24 hours a day. Next door in Seaview, one year-round resident, Peter Brennan, a 48-year-old contractor, estimated that it would take at least six months to reconstruct his house, which was severely flooded and sustained damage to the electrical and heating systems. He plans to raise the pilings under the house from their current height of two feet to eight feet, noting that the houses on taller pilings were damaged the least. But his first concern, at this moment, is the well-being of his children. His wife and two sons are temporarily living in Bay Shore while he tends to the storm damage. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge disruption in everyone\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of our sons spoke to his school psychologist. He was afraid I would get hurt. I told him we\u2019re all wearing helmets.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9800E2D71438F933A15752C1A9649D8B63","body":"7:12 p.m. | Updated JPMorgan Chase named a new chief financial officer on Monday, the latest management shakeup by the bank after a multibillion-dollar trading blunder earlier this year. Marianne Lake, 43, who is the C.F.O. for the consumer and community banking business, will replace Douglas Braunstein as chief financial officer early next year. The reshuffling follows a spate of executive changes that have come in the wake of the trading loss by JPMorgan's chief investment office in London, a misstep that undercut the bank's reputation as a deft manager of risk and renewed warnings from lawmakers that some firms on Wall Street are too unwieldy to manage. Since announcing the losses on a soured bet on credit derivatives in May, the losses have swelled and stand at $6.25 billion for the year. With her latest role, Ms. Lake will become one of the most powerful women on Wall Street, joining Ruth Porat of Morgan Stanley as the only other woman working as a chief financial officer of a leading American bank. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, described Ms. Lake as \"exceptionally talented.\" As the controller of the bank's investment banking business, Ms. Lake worked with Mr. Dimon after JPMorgan swooped in to rescue Bear Stearns in March 2008. In an interview on Monday, Ms. Lake said that her experience at the bank would help with her transition. \"I feel like I have had a chance to work in our investment bank and our consumer business, including mortgage, and work in them at some of the most critical times and in roles where I was on the battlefield,\" she said. Ms. Lake, who started her career as a chartered accountant at PricewaterhouseCoopers in their London and Sydney offices, said she planned to work \"across the firm with all the businesses to them each advance their agendas.\" Mr. Braunstein, 51, had been expected to step down. Some at the bank wondered if he had lost credibility in the wake of the trading losses, according to several senior bank executives. Just weeks before the trading errors were first disclosed, Mr. Braunstein told analysts he was \"very comfortable with the positions we have.\" By July, as losses mounted, early signs of Mr. Braunstein's diminished status at the bank appeared , according to the senior executives. As part of a new organization, JPMorgan united its consumer businesses under a single awning, and its investment banking and treasury operations under another. Under the new structure, Mr. Braunstein no longer reported to Mr. Dimon. But the chief executive said on Monday that the appointment of Ms. Lake had nothing to do with the trading losses and stemmed, instead, from Mr. Braunstein's own request. \"Doug told me awhile ago that he wanted to go back to his true love of investment banking,\" Mr. Dimon said. He added that Mr. Braunstein \"has had a great and interesting ride as C.F.O.\" Other executives have stepped down following the trading losses. The most notable has been Ina R. Drew, who ran the chief investment office and was long a trusted lieutenant of Mr. Dimon. After Ms. Drew's resignation in May, the thin ranks of women in the top ranks of Wall Street grew even thinner. Last year, another high ranking executive at JPMorgan, Heidi Miller, announced that she was leaving the bank. Still, another woman, Blythe Masters, who heads JPMorgan's commodities business, had also been considered for the job of chief financial officer, according to the senior executives.

Some 300,000 party members were entitled to vote in 650 different polling places, and partial results late on Sunday showed Mr. Cop\u00e9 with a narrow lead. Both men claimed victory, and the closeness of the result will not help the party find a clear direction. Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s defeat badly bruised the party, known as the U.M.P. for its initials in French, and it was followed by defeat in legislative elections in June. Now, much like the Republican Party in the United States, the U.M.P. faces difficult choices as it tries to redefine itself and work through a crisis of identity. Its one advantage now is that the Socialist government of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who replaced Mr. Sarkozy, is already declining in popularity as it struggles to rein in the nation\u2019s budget deficit and avert a recession. In essence, the U.M.P. must decide whether it will remain the political heir to the party founded by Charles de Gaulle after World War II, or will move to the right in the face of a challenge from the far-right National Front. Mr. Fillon, 58, is a traditional conservative who, as prime minister, managed to remain personally popular even as his hyperactive boss sank in opinion polls. Quiet and urbane, and a touch dull, he has tried to steer the party toward the center, hoping to attract voters who opted to support Mr. Hollande for president but who are already growing disillusioned with his performance. Mr. Cop\u00e9, 48, generally shares Mr. Fillon\u2019s views on economic policy and Europe. But as a legislator and mayor of Meaux, northeast of Paris, he has been decidedly more provocative in his statements. He has also been unabashed in his efforts to woo voters from the National Front, whose strong showing at the polls this year split the conservative vote, sealing Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s fate as the country\u2019s first one-term president in three decades. Mr. Cop\u00e9 describes himself as a \u201cnonpracticing Jew\u201d whose mother was born in Algeria and whose paternal grandfather immigrated from Romania. Some see him as a man in the Sarkozy mold, supporting the former president\u2019s tough policies on immigration and the role of Islam in French society. But critics call him \u201cSarkozy lite.\u201d During the campaign, Mr. Cop\u00e9 \u2014 a driving force behind a 2011 law that banned the wearing of the burqa, or full veil, in public \u2014 adopted a more divisive tone, focusing on themes like stricter immigration laws and the reinforcement of France\u2019s secularism, as a not-so-subtle response to fears of radical Islam. Last month, in \u201cA Manifesto for an Uninhibited Right,\u201d Mr. Cop\u00e9 wrote that the suburbs of France\u2019s biggest cities had become bastions of \u201canti-white racism,\u201d a term much discussed and mocked in the French news media. He later used his Twitter account to relay an anecdote about a child who had been robbed of a chocolate pastry by \u201cthugs\u201d who were said to be enforcing the Ramadan fast. The remarks prompted outrage on the left and produced cringing among some U.M.P. members. \u201cAll these little phrases are toxic and dangerous,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Baroin, a former Sarkozy finance minister and a supporter of Mr. Fillon. Benoist Apparu, a former junior minister, concurred. \u201cSuch positions weaken our political family,\u201d he said. Others disagreed. \u201cHe speaks the truth about these things that others are afraid to say,\u201d said Nadine Morano, a former minister close to Mr. Sarkozy who backed Mr. Cop\u00e9. His frankness is especially appealing to \u201cexasperated\u201d young conservatives, she said. \u201cThey are very attached to the language of the truth.\u201d For Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front, Mr. Cop\u00e9\u2019s strategy was an admission that party leaders are out of touch. \u201cThe U.M.P. rank and file feels much closer to our positions than to those of the U.M.P. leadership,\u201d she said in a radio interview. \u201cMr. Cop\u00e9 is chasing after his base.\u201d This election will give analysts \u201ca sense of the balance of power,\u201d said Bruno Cautr\u00e8s, a public opinion specialist at the Center for Political Research at the Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques, or Sciences Po. \u201cIt will determine their electoral strategy \u2014 not only for 2017, but for interim elections in 2014.\u201d After losing the presidency and both houses of the legislature in June, the party is now focusing on local and municipal elections scheduled in just over a year\u2019s time. Local government is dominated by the left now, but with Mr. Hollande\u2019s government struggling, analysts suggested that the right could make real gains. Regardless of who becomes the leader of the party, the U.M.P. is likely to continue its delicate dance with far-right voters while avoiding any outright alliance with the National Front. \u201cMarine Le Pen is young; she\u2019s only 43 years old,\u201d Mr. Cautr\u00e8s said. \u201cThe French right will have to deal with her for some time.\u201d Both Mr. Fillon and Mr. Cop\u00e9 reject any partnership with the National Front, a move that would be considered politically suicidal. The U.M.P. is already displaying some nostalgia for Mr. Sarkozy, 57. After a summer spent on the beaches of Morocco and southern France, he began a series of public appearances that seemed choreographed to keep him in the picture for the presidential race in 2017. The French news media has seemed only happy to oblige him: \u201cYoo-hoo! I\u2019m back!\u201d was the headline on a recent cover of the magazine Le Point, over a photo of Mr. Sarkozy. \u201cLike any president who has been beaten \u2014 especially after only one term, and so narrowly \u2014 he dreams of revenge,\u201d Mr. Cautr\u00e8s said. \u201cOfficially, he makes it seem like he has turned the page, that he lives another life. But that is a complete fantasy.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9503E2D91638F93AA25752C1A9649D8B63","body":"Congratulations! Your start-up is now valued at over $1 billion! This might seem exciting, as though you've won a lottery. But in reality, when you recheck your lottery ticket, you might find you were off by a single number. You see, being in the Billion-Dollar Start-Up Club limits how, and if, a company can get out of the Billion-Dollar Start-Up Club - at least safely. The Club is growing quickly. Based on recent financing rounds and stories about the companies, Twitter is valued at $8.5 billion; LivingSocial at $5 billion; Dropbox, $4 billion; Square, $3.25 billion; Spotify, $3 billion; Rovio, $3 billion; Airbnb, $2.5 billion; Pinterest, $1.5 billion; Box, $1.2 billion; Gilt Groupe, $1.1 billion; and Evernote, $1 billion. Dozens more companies are within arms' reach, including Foursquare, WordPress, GitHub, Quora and Fab. They have a lot to worry about. First, when you're the most expensive product on the shelf, very few companies can afford to buy you. Apple, Google and maybe Microsoft are on a short list of corporations that could finance an acquisition of this size without reaching for lint in their pockets afterward. Given that Apple rarely makes acquisitions, that leaves Google, Microsoft and possibly Facebook. And speaking of Facebook: after its lackluster initial public offering, when its stock dropped by half, going public isn't very appealing. Groupon, valued at $12.65 billion before its public offering at $20 a share, is now trading at a mere $2.98. Zynga, another member of the Club, is now $2.21 a share, down from a high of $15.91 this year. \"As a start-up valuation increases, the options definitely decrease,\" said Jon Callaghan, a partner with True Ventures who has been investing since the early 1990s. When you're valued at more than $1 billion, he said, \"you have to have a flawless execution, as it's upping the ante quite a bit.\" Some of these companies' valuations might be justified by revenue and growth. DropBox, for instance, has an estimated $500 million in revenue and 100 million users. Others, like Pinterest and Fab, are as overhyped as Pets.com was in Tech Bubble 1.0. If these companies are deemed overvalued, they may have no option but to perform so-called down round investments, where a round of private financing prices a company at a lower valuation than a previous investment. That almost happened to Spotify, the music streaming service. In May, the company was ready to close a round of financing that would have valued it at $4 billion. Then Facebook nose-dived, and Netflix, which is the closest example of a subscription-based online service like Spotify, also stumbled. Spotify finally closed a round this month that valued it at $3 billion - $1 billion off its projected valuation just six months ago. \"You certainly have more options at the $10 million valuation and a lot more paths you can go down,\" acknowledged Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box, a corporate cloud storage start-up. \"But there's a virtue to having less options in that it gives us the ability to focus, and our visibility of what we need to do is much clearer.\" Start-ups with higher valuations can also run into trouble when trying to woo new talent. If an engineer joins a company valued at $10 million that grows to $1 billion, there is an opportunity to get very rich. That is not the case when joining a company already valued at 10 figures that might slip to six or seven figures. As for Facebook's paltry stock performance affecting other I.P.O.'s, Mr. Levie said this could actually help start-ups by allowing them to stave off investors and focus on their business models. \"Ultimately, it shouldn't be anyone's goal to go public; this is just a financing event to create liquidity for investors and shareholders,\" he said. \"I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that there are eight to 10 companies that make $1 billion acquisitions in the enterprise space. It's mostly the consumer space where this becomes less probable.\" He added, \"There you really only have one suitor: Google.\" Sometimes joining the Billion-Dollar Start-Up Club isn't really as much fun as it might seem.

Often decried for moral or social reasons, inequality imperils the economy, too; the International Monetary Fund recently warned that high income inequality could damage a country\u2019s long-term growth. But the real menace for our long-term prosperity is not income inequality \u2014 it\u2019s wealth inequality, which distorts access to economic opportunities.Wealth inequality has worsened for two decades and is now at an extreme level. Replacing the income, estate and gift taxes with a progressive wealth tax would do much more to reduce it than any other tax plan being considered in Washington. When economists try to measure inequality, they typically focus on income, because the data are most readily accessible. But income is not always a good gauge of economic power. Consider a group of people who all have high incomes but differ widely in their wealth. Who\u2019s going to get into the country club? Who\u2019s going to have the money to finance a new venture? Moreover, income data may not reveal the true economic power of people who are retired, or who receive their pay in securities like stocks and options or use complex strategies to avoid taxes. Trends in the distribution of wealth can look very different from trends in incomes, because wealth is a measure of accumulated assets, not a flow over time. High earners add much more to their wealth every year than low earners. Over time, wealth inequality rises even as income inequality stays the same, and wealth inequality eventually becomes much more severe. This is exactly what happened in the United States. A common statistical measure of inequality is the Gini coefficient, a number between 0 and 100 that rises with greater disparities. From the late 1970s through the early 1990s, the Census Bureau recorded Gini coefficients for income in the low 40s. Yet by 1992, the Gini coefficient for wealth had risen into the mid-70s, according to data from the Federal Reserve. Since then, it has risen steadily, to about 80 as of 2010. In 1992, the top tenth of the population controlled 20 times the wealth controlled by the bottom half. By 2010, it was 65 times. Our graduated income-tax system redistributes a small amount of money every year but does little to slow the polarization of wealth. These are stunning changes. The global financial crisis did make a dent in the assets of the wealthiest American families, but its effects for the bottom half were utterly destructive; the number of owner-occupied homes has fallen by more than a million since 2007. People in different socioeconomic strata are living ever more different lives, with dangerous results for society: erosion of empathy, widening of rifts and undermining of meritocracy. American household wealth totaled more than $58 trillion in 2010. A flat wealth tax of just 1.5 percent on financial assets and other wealth like housing, cars and business ownership would have been more than enough to replace all the revenue of the income, estate and gift taxes, which amounted to about $833 billion after refunds. Brackets of, say, zero percent up to $500,000 in wealth, 1 percent for wealth between $500,000 and $1 million, and 2 percent for wealth above $1 million would probably have done the trick as well. These tax rates would garner a small portion of the extra wealth America\u2019s richest families could expect to accrue simply by investing what they already had. The rates would also be enough to slow \u2014 if not reverse \u2014 the increase in inequality. To see how the wealth tax would work, consider a family with $500,000 in wealth and $200,000 in annual income. Right now, they might pay $50,000 in federal income tax. With the wealth tax brackets described above, they would pay nothing. On the other hand, a family with $4 million in wealth and $200,000 in annual income would owe $65,000. Most families that depend on their wealth for their income would pay more, and most that depend on their earnings would pay less. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb Daniel Altman, an adjunct associate professor of economics at the New York University Stern School of Business and a former member of the New York Times editorial board, is writing a book about what would happen if the United States defaulted on its debts."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/19\/technology\/19iht-tax19.html","body":"PARIS \u2014 Google reported sales of more than $4 billion in Britain last year. It paid less than $10 million in taxes.Some tax collectors, lawmakers and competitors of Google in Europe say this is unfair. As governments throughout the region seek to close gaping holes in their budgets, they are taking aim at United States multinational companies, especially Internet giants like Google and Amazon.com, which pay little or no taxes in Europe, despite generating billions of dollars in revenue on the Continent. \u201cWhy on earth do you manipulate your accounts so that you get away with not paying corporation tax in the U.K.?\u201d Margaret Hodge, a member of Parliament, asked representatives of Google, Amazon and Starbucks last week, during a heated committee hearing in London. In France, tax collectors have gone further. Amazon says it has received a bill from France for taxes and penalties related to the \u201callocation of income between foreign jurisdictions\u201d from 2006 through 2010. Other companies, including Google, are also reportedly in the French authorities\u2019 sights. \u201cEven if the Internet is a zone of freedom, it shouldn\u2019t be a lawless zone,\u201d Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, a spokeswoman for the French government, said last week. \u201cFiscal rules should be able to be applied to those activities as well.\u201d Google, Amazon, Starbucks and other American companies facing tax scrutiny say they are doing nothing wrong. They use complex accounting strategies to exploit national differences across Europe in corporate tax rates, which range from less than 10 percent to more than 30 percent, and loopholes that can reduce their effective European tax levies to almost nothing. Google, for example, records most of its international revenue at its European headquarters in Ireland, where the corporate tax rate is 12.5 percent. Across Europe, customers who buy advertising, Google\u2019s primary source of revenue, sign contracts with the company\u2019s subsidiary in Ireland, rather than with local branches. Google ends up paying Irish taxes on only a fraction of the billions of euros that course through its Dublin office. That is because the company uses a variety of methods, including royalty payments to a unit in Bermuda, to reduce further the amount of money exposed to tax liability. So, while Google told the Securities and Exchange Commission that it generated more than $4 billion in sales in Britain last year, it reported revenue of only \u00a3396 million, or $629 million, in its official filings there. The total, the company said, reflected the amount that Google\u2019s British unit billed Google Ireland for promotional work, consulting and other activities. Google declared a profit of \u00a331 million in Britain, resulting in a British tax bill of only \u00a36 million. \u201cWe pay the tax we are required to pay in every country in which we operate,\u201d Matt Brittin, Google vice president for North and Central Europe, told the parliamentary panel. Ms. Hodge, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, acknowledged that she thought Google, Amazon and Starbucks were probably complying with the law. \u201cWe are not accusing you of being illegal, we are accusing you of being immoral,\u201d she said. In France, more than morality is at stake. In his testimony to the parliamentary panel, Andrew Cecil, director of public policy for Amazon in Europe, confirmed that the company had received a demand for $252 million from the French tax collection agency. He said Amazon was contesting the claim, which was originally disclosed in an American regulatory filing. Amazon, which has European headquarters in Luxembourg, another small country with favorable tax conditions for multinational companies, reported 9.1 billion euros, or $11.6 billion, in revenue across Europe last year. It posted an after-tax profit of 20 million euros on those sales, and paid about 8 million euros in tax, Mr. Cecil said. Mr. Cecil told the parliamentary committee that when customers across Europe bought books from Amazon, they were actually buying them from the Luxembourg-based Amazon entity, rather than their local subsidiaries. That response was met with incredulity by Ms. Hodge, who noted that when she ordered a book from the company, she used a British Web site, Amazon.co.uk, and the goods were delivered from a British warehouse via the British Royal Mail. News reports in France note that French fiscal authorities are also seeking back taxes and penalties from Google, amounting to 1.7 billion euros. Ms. Vallaud-Belkacem told reporters that she could not comment on individual companies for privacy reasons. Google, in a statement, said the reports were premature. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/19\/opinion\/judicial-elections-unhinged.html","body":"This year\u2019s round of state judicial elections broke previous records for the amounts spent on judicial campaigns around the country. The dominant role played by special-interest money \u2014 including money from super PACs financed by undisclosed donors \u2014 has severely weakened the principle of fair and impartial courts.In Florida, for example, three respected State Supreme Court justices won their retention election battles, but only after they were forced to raise more than $1.5 million in total. They had put on expensive campaigns because they were targeted for defeat by moneyed conservatives who wanted to drive them off the bench for their supposed liberal views. The justices were absolutely right to fight back. Still, the bitter campaigns leave impressions of judicial partisanship and indebtedness to campaign donors. Nationally, spending on television advertisements in state supreme court races reached nearly $28 million by Election Day, exceeding the $24.4 million in 2004, the previous record for a presidential election year, according to the Brennan Center for Justice and Justice at Stake, nonpartisan groups working for fair courts. Groups not connected to candidate campaigns paid for more than half of the TV ads run, compared with about 30 percent in 2010, making it much harder for candidates to control their own message. In Michigan, where three of seven seats on the State Supreme Court were up for election, records were set for both spending and lack of accountability. The $3.2 million raised by candidates and reported to the Michigan Bureau of Elections was dwarfed by unreported spending by the political parties and outside groups interested in tilting the balance on the court. One ad run by an independent group against Bridget McCormack, a Democratic candidate for a seat on the court, featured the mother of a soldier killed in Afghanistan and suggested that Ms. McCormack\u2019s legal work for a detainee released from Guant\u00e1namo Bay in 2007 showed support for terrorism. Ms. McCormack won the race. Of the $15 million or so spent for TV ads in Michigan, 75 percent cannot be attributed to identifiable donors, notes Rich Robinson, executive director of the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, which advocates changing Michigan law to bar undisclosed independent spending. That exceeds even the 2010 record, when half the total spending on Michigan Supreme Court races came from secret sources. Regrettably, states that elect their top judges show no inclination to address these distressing trends by replacing judicial elections with systems of merit appointment that avoid retention votes. This year\u2019s experience should at least hasten state efforts to revise rules for judicial recusal to take campaign contributions into account. Mandatory disclosure of all donations to a judicial race is also essential. Litigants cannot know when they should request that a judge step aside if they cannot tell whether their case involves a party that supported the judge\u2019s campaign."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/19\/business\/media\/news-from-the-advertising-industry.html","body":"Accounts\u00b6Loews Hotels and Resorts, New York, part of the Loews Corporation, named Catch New York as agency of record, to handle tasks like creative, media planning and buying, branding and digital advertising.

In other words, is the French socialist president condemned to be always behind the curve with reform, as the conservative Spanish prime minister is? Or can he get ahead of it, as the technocratic Italian premier has? I put this question to my fellow guests at a dinner in Paris last week. France is not at imminent risk of blowing up, as wrongly implied by the British magazine The Economist, with its latest dramatic front cover showing baguettes tied together like sticks of dynamite with a lighted fuse. It is a much richer country than Spain. And its people are more willing to pay their taxes than are the Italians. French 10-year borrowing costs are only 2.1 percent, compared with Italy\u2019s 4.9 percent and Spain\u2019s 5.9 percent. That said, France has three deep-seated problems that could ultimately cause a megacrisis if not addressed: Its public spending, at the equivalent of 56 percent of gross domestic product, is way too high; its industry has seen a steady erosion of competitiveness; and the population is in a state of denial and just does not accept the need for change. The latter cannot be said of either Italians or Spaniards. It is not easy to answer the question about what sort of leader Mr. Hollande, who has now been in office for six months, will be. He certainly started off like Mr. Rajoy. During his election campaign, he did nothing to prepare the population for the sacrifices ahead. Indeed, he made promises he could not keep. The French president spent his first few months in office merrily attacking the wealthy, pushing up taxes and partly reversing his predecessor\u2019s changes to pension plans. That anti- enterprise message has eroded the trust of the business community \u2014 which is precisely the opposite of what France needs, as it flirts with a renewed recession. Mr. Hollande, like Mr. Rajoy, is a politician. He had to get elected, a process that almost invariably forces leaders to sugar-coat their messages. Mr. Monti, by contrast, did not have to face the ballot box, and so has not had to go back on any promises. He also had a clear idea of the problems Italy faced \u2014 unlike Mr. Hollande and Mr. Rajoy \u2014 and so did not need to waste time learning on the job. Mr. Hollande and Mr. Rajoy have been forced into U-turns on issues like sales taxes, which has been part of the reason their popularity has plummeted. Mr. Hollande\u2019s approval rating has sunk to 36 percent, from 60 percent when he took office. Mr. Monti\u2019s popularity, though, remains high. That said, Mr. Hollande is more adept than the Spanish prime minister at making U-turns. The increase in sales tax was needed partially to finance a cut of \u20ac20 billion, or $25.5 billion, in taxes on employers. This is a classic \u201cinternal devaluation,\u201d which will go some way toward restoring France\u2019s competitiveness. The rest of the money for funding that tax cut will come from spending cuts \u2014 again, a good move, even though the source of them has not been specified. Mr. Hollande largely adopted the recommendations of a report on competitiveness he had commissioned from Louis Gallois, the former boss of European Aeronautic Defense & Space. The French president also started softening up the population on the need for changes in a widely praised news conference last week. That is important, because it suggests that he, at least, is no longer in denial. What is not clear is whether he can press ahead further after losing the trust of parts of both the business community and the electorate. In the past 30 years, France has witnessed several attempts at change that have been abandoned in midcourse. The people have a habit of taking to the streets or striking in protest at even minor infringements to their privileges \u2014 something that makes the Greeks or the Spaniards look like stoics in comparison. The internal devaluation was a dry run for Mr. Hollande\u2019s big test: overhauling the sclerotic labor market. More flexibility is needed to keep labor costs down and encourage businesses to invest \u2014 both of which will be required if unemployment is to be prevented from rising too much from an already uncomfortable 10 percent. Unfortunately, two big changes are not in the cards: an abandonment of the French 35-hour workweek or a cut in the minimum wage. However, it will still be possible to make improvements to competitiveness if the package is sufficiently radical. Mr. Hollande has not yet spelled out what he wants. Instead, he has asked employers and unions to sit down and negotiate a new deal. That was one tactic employed by Mr. Monti that did not prove effective. Italy\u2019s resulting labor reform is half-hearted. That said, the Medef, the French employers\u2019 association, has come out with a robust initial opening position in the negotiations. What is more, a socialist is probably better placed to persuade the unions of the need to change than a conservative president would be. So the question really comes down to how much courage Mr. Hollande has. My dinner companions and others I saw in Paris were divided on the topic. Some said Mr. Hollande would do only the minimum, and that at the last possible moment. One argued that, although he was good at navigating political shoals, he had no sense of direction. Others said he was a natural optimist who understood that change was necessary but underestimated its urgency. One, though, said he might surprise everybody by realizing that changing France was his historical opportunity and that he would then display audacity. We must all hope that is the correct assessment.

It was a school night; the TV was on in the living room, and her mother was folding clothes on the couch. Without thinking, Ashlyn Blocker reached her right hand in to retrieve the spoon, then took her hand out of the water and stood looking at it under the oven light. She walked a few steps to the sink and ran cold water over all her faded white scars, then called to her mother, \u201cI just put my fingers in!\u201d Her mother, Tara Blocker, dropped the clothes and rushed to her daughter\u2019s side. \u201cOh, my lord!\u201d she said \u2014 after 13 years, that same old fear \u2014 and then she got some ice and gently pressed it against her daughter\u2019s hand, relieved that the burn wasn\u2019t worse.\u201cI showed her how to get another utensil and fish the spoon out,\u201d Tara said with a weary laugh when she recounted the story to me two months later. \u201cAnother thing,\u201d she said, \u201cshe\u2019s starting to use flat irons for her hair, and those things get superhot.\u201d Tara was sitting on the couch in a T-shirt printed with the words \u201cCamp Painless But Hopeful.\u201d Ashlyn was curled on the living-room carpet crocheting a purse from one of the skeins of yarn she keeps piled in her room. Her 10-year-old sister, Tristen, was in the leather recliner, asleep on top of their father, John Blocker, who stretched out there after work and was slowly falling asleep, too. The house smelled of the homemade macaroni and cheese they were going to have for dinner. A South Georgia rainstorm drummed the gutters, and lightning illuminated the batting cage and the pool in the backyard. Without lifting her eyes from the crochet hooks in her hands, Ashlyn spoke up to add one detail to her mother\u2019s story. \u201cI was just thinking, What did I just do?\u201d she said. Over six days with the Blockers, I watched Ashlyn behave like any 13-year-old girl, brushing her hair, dancing around and jumping on her bed. I also saw her run without regard for her body through the house as her parents pleaded with her to stop. And she played an intense game of air hockey with her sister, slamming the puck on the table as hard and fast as she could. When she made an egg sandwich on the skillet, she pressed her hands onto the bread as Tara had taught her, to make sure it was cool before she put it into her mouth. She can feel warmth and coolness, but not the more extreme temperatures that would cause anyone else to recoil in pain. Tara and John weren\u2019t completely comfortable leaving Ashlyn alone in the kitchen, but it was something they felt they had to do, a concession to her growing independence. They made a point of telling stories about how responsible she is, but every one came with a companion anecdote that was painful to hear. There was the time she burned the flesh off the palms of her hands when she was 2. John was using a pressure-washer in the driveway and left its motor running; in the moments that they took their eyes off her, Ashlyn walked over and put her hands on the muffler. When she lifted them up the skin was seared away. There was the one about the fire ants that swarmed her in the backyard, biting her over a hundred times while she looked at them and yelled: \u201cBugs! Bugs!\u201d There was the time she broke her ankle and ran around on it for two days before her parents realized something was wrong. They told these stories as casually as they talked about Tristen\u2019s softball games or their son Dereck\u2019s golf skills, but it was clear they were still struggling after all these years with how to keep Ashlyn safe. A couple of nights after telling me the story about putting her hand in the boiling water, Ashlyn sat in the kitchen, playing with the headband that held back her long brown hair. We had all been drawing on napkins and playing checkers and listening to Ashlyn and Tristen sing \u201cCall Me Maybe,\u201d when all of a sudden Tara gasped and lifted the hair away from her daughter\u2019s ears. She was bleeding beneath it. The headband had been cutting into her skin entire time we were sitting there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Next Page \u00bb Justin Heckert is a writer in Indianapolis.

In turn, a borrower agrees to a payment plan that would bring the mortgage current within a set period of time. Borrowers in disaster areas who expect they will have difficulty making their regular mortgage payments on time should contact their loan servicer to explain their circumstances. (Designated disaster areas can be found at fema.gov\/disasters.) Servicers have been authorized to grant the 90-day respite right over the phone. \u201cNo documentation is needed in this moment of emergency,\u201d Mr. German said. \u201cThe key point is to streamline the process from the servicers\u2019 point of view so they can help more people.\u201d Borrowers who have had their mortgages modified under the Home Affordable Modification Program are also eligible for forbearance. A mortgage reprieve will ease the financial burden on those who have had storm-related expenses like hotel and restaurant bills. It will also give borrowers who have suffered extensive property damage the time they need to \u201cfocus and think,\u201d said Peter Elkowitz Jr., the chief executive of the Long Island Housing Partnership, a nonprofit affordable housing developer and provider of foreclosure counseling services. \u201cThey have to decide, if they have the money to rebuild,\u201d he said, \u201care they going to build in the same location, or are they going to move?\u201d After 90 days, the forbearance period may be extended up to a year, on a case-by-case basis. Servicers are to waive any late payment charges, and suspend the reporting of missed payments to national credit bureaus. Even borrowers who were in foreclosure before the storm will get a breather. The agencies say they are suspending foreclosure sales and evictions for 90 days. The foreclosure suspension also applies to mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Before borrowers contact their servicer for help, they should first try to determine who owns their loan. To find out if Fannie Mae owns your loan, go to knowyouroptions.com\/loanlookup. The link for Freddie Mac is freddiemac.com\/corporate\/. If homeowners lost their financial documents in the storm, or if they are still without power, they may not know where to start, Mr. Elkowitz noted. He advises people in this category to contact a counseling agency certified by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which can then reach out on their behalf. At the Long Island Housing Partnership, Mr. Elkowitz is expecting \u201ca whole new group of people coming in, people who wouldn\u2019t normally have been in a default situation. \u201cNow their house is destroyed,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are trying to keep their job, and they have to look for a new place to live.\u201d His agency is helping borrowers whose homes were damaged, but not ruined, by flooding. Using emergency funds donated by Citibank, it will help homeowners in low- to moderate-income areas repair or replace water-damaged electrical systems, furnaces and water heaters."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/18\/fashion\/weddings\/stacy-gordon-steven-tulgan-weddings.html","body":"Stacy Ann Gordon and Steven Tulgan were married Saturday at Temple B\u2019rith Kodesh in Rochester.

But its hyper-tolerant facade often masks deeply conservative, outdated norms that digital culture discreetly imposes on billions of technology users worldwide. What is the vehicle for this new prudishness? Dour, one-dimensional algorithms, the mathematical constructs that automatically determine the limits of what is culturally acceptable. Consider just a few recent kerfuffles. In early September, The New Yorker found its Facebook page blocked for violating the site\u2019s nudity and sex standards. Its offense: a cartoon of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Eve\u2019s bared nipples failed Facebook\u2019s decency test. That\u2019s right \u2014 a venerable publication that still spells \u201cre-elect\u201d as \u201cre\u00eblect\u201d is less puritan than a Californian start-up that wants to \u201cmake the world more open.\u201d And fighting obscenity can be good for business. Impermium, a Silicon Valley company that helps Web sites deal with unwanted reader comments, has begun marketing technology that identifies \u201call kinds of harmful content \u2014 such as violence, racism, flagrant profanity, and hate speech \u2014 and allows site owners to act on it in real-time, before it reaches readers.\u201d Impermium will police the readers \u2014 but who will police Impermium? Apple, too, has strayed from its iconoclastic roots. When Naomi Wolf\u2019s latest book, \u201cVagina: A New Biography,\u201d went on sale in its iBooks store, Apple turned \u201cVagina\u201d into \u201cV****a.\u201d After numerous complaints, Apple restored the title, but who knows how many other books are still affected? True, these books are still on sale. Unlike the good old United States Post Office, which once confiscated \u201cLady Chatterley\u2019s Lover\u201d and other books it deemed too lewd, Silicon Valley does not engage in direct censorship. What it does, though, is present ideas and terms that have gained public acceptance as something to be ashamed of. Silicon Valley doesn\u2019t just reflect social norms \u2014 it actively shapes them in ways that are, for the most part, imperceptible. The proliferation of the Autocomplete function on popular Web sites is a case in point. Nominally, all it does is complete your search query \u2014 on YouTube, on Google, on Amazon \u2014 before you\u2019ve finished typing, using an algorithm to predict what you\u2019re most likely typing. A nifty feature \u2014 but it, too, reinforces primness. How so? Consider George Carlin\u2019s classic comedy routine \u201cSeven Words You Can Never Say on Television.\u201d See how many of those words would autocomplete on your favorite Web site. In my case, YouTube would autocomplete none. Amazon almost none (it also hates \u201cpenis\u201d and \u201cvagina\u201d). Of Carlin\u2019s seven words, Google would autocomplete only \u201cpiss.\u201d Until recently, even the word \u201cbisexual\u201d wouldn\u2019t autocomplete at Google; it\u2019s only this past August that Google, after many complaints, began to autocomplete some, but not all, queries for that term. In 2010, the hacker magazine 2600 published a long blacklist of similar words. While I didn\u2019t verify all 400 of them on Google, a few that I did try \u2014 like \u201cswastika\u201d and \u201cLolita\u201d \u2014 failed to autocomplete. Is Nabokov not trending in Mountain View? Alas, these algorithms are not particularly bright: unable to distinguish between Nabokov\u2019s novel and child pornography, they assume you want the latter. Why won\u2019t tech companies let us freely use terms that already enjoy wide circulation and legitimacy? Do they fashion themselves as our new guardians? Are they too greedy to correct their algorithms\u2019 mistakes? Thanks to Silicon Valley, our public life is undergoing a transformation. Accompanying this digital metamorphosis is the emergence of new, algorithmic gatekeepers, who, unlike the gatekeepers of the previous era \u2014 journalists, publishers, editors \u2014 don\u2019t flaunt their cultural authority. They may even be unaware of it themselves, eager to deploy algorithms for fun and profit. Many of these gatekeepers remain invisible \u2014 until something goes wrong. Thus, in early September, the online livestream from the Hugo Awards, the Oscars of the science fiction world, was interrupted with a cryptic copyright warning, right before the popular author Neil Gaiman was to deliver an acceptance speech. Apparently, Ustream \u2014 the site streaming the ceremony \u2014 was using the services of another company to determine whether its streamed videos violated any copyrights. The partner company draws on a very large video archive to see, in real time, if what\u2019s being streamed matches anything in its collection. Somehow, the celebratory video that preceded Mr. Gaiman\u2019s speech tripped a copyright match, and the feed was cut off, even though the organizers had all the requisite permissions (and, under the doctrine of fair use, probably didn\u2019t need them anyway). 1 2 Next Page \u00bb The author of the forthcoming book \u201cTo Save Everything, Click Here: The Folly of Technological Solutionism.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/18\/us\/texas-legislators-may-consider-options-for-tuition-deregulation.html","body":"The 2013 legislative session will mark the 10th anniversary of a decision by Texas lawmakers to deregulate college tuition, giving the authority to set tuition at public universities to the institutions.Since deregulation, the average cost of tuition and fees at the state\u2019s public universities has increased by 90 percent, according to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. Some lawmakers are hoping the new session will provide an opportunity to regain control of the price-setting process. \u201cIt\u2019s past time for the Legislature to stop abdicating its responsibility and instead make some tough decisions on tuition,\u201d said Senator Rodney Ellis, Democrat of Houston. He was in the minority when he voted against deregulation in 2003, but he believes the tide may be turning. Of the 181 members of the state\u2019s coming 83rd Legislature, more than 50 have voted at least once to advance efforts to end tuition deregulation, while fewer than 20 have consistently voted to uphold it. Many have never voted on the issue, and more than 40 members are freshmen. \u201cWith the number of fresh faces in both houses this upcoming session, I think enough members are willing to explore new ideas on how to keep the cost of higher education affordable for Texas families,\u201d Mr. Ellis said. Senator Tommy Williams, Republican of The Woodlands and the new chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, called his approval of tuition deregulation \u201cone of the two worst votes I ever cast in my legislative career.\u201d Talk of ending deregulation is certain to meet resistance from universities, and not all lawmakers feel it should happen. Senator Judith Zaffirini, Democrat of Laredo, who was recently replaced as the chairwoman of the Senate Higher Education Committee, reluctantly voted for deregulation in 2003. \u201cIt was the right thing to do at the time,\u201d she said. Ms. Zaffirini said that the tuition issue should be considered in relation to state financial support for higher education institutions and financial aid. Neither is expected to increase in the 2013 session, and tuition increases help universities make up for that in their budgets. Rising tuition has also been on Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s mind. His higher education initiatives heading into the session include locking in a student\u2019s tuition at a flat rate for four years and instituting degrees that cost $10,000. Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Mr. Perry, said he still supports deregulation but hopes it is not a rubber stamp to increase tuition arbitrarily every year. Dan Branch, Republican of Dallas and chairman of the House Higher Education Committee, said that legislators have encouraged universities over the years to keep tuition increases manageable. Senator Kel Seliger, Republican of Amarillo, who replaced Ms. Zaffirini on the Higher Education Committee, is open to discussing tuition. \u201cOne question that has got to be asked is: What should tuition be?\u201d Mr. Seliger said, adding that he would prefer universities to come up with a solution without legislators stepping in. But some lawmakers are already at that point. \u201cEver since it passed and we saw those first tuition increases, I\u2019ve been trying to put the genie back in the bottle,\u201d Senator Williams said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to turn it around, but maybe this will be the session.\u201d rhamilton@texastribune.org"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/18\/world\/asia\/family-ties-and-hobnobbing-are-keys-to-power-in-china.html","body":"BEIJING \u2014 To a degree, the new leaders of China named just days ago have backgrounds that are as uniform as the dark suits and red ties they wore at their coming-out ceremony.The seven men on the Politburo Standing Committee have forged close relations to previous party leaders, either through their families or institutional networks. They have exhibited little in the way of vision or initiative during their careers. And most have been allies or prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of Jiang Zemin, the octogenarian former party chief. The Communist Party and its acolytes like to brag that the party promotion system is a meritocracy, producing leaders better suited to run a country than those who emerge from the cacophony of elections and partisan bickering in full-blown democracies. But critics, including a number of party insiders, say that China\u2019s secretive selection process, rooted in personal networks, has actually created a meritocracy of mediocrity. Those who do less in the way of bold policy during their political rise \u2014 and expend their energies instead hobnobbing with senior officials over rice wine at banquets or wooing them with vanity-stroking projects \u2014 appear to have a greater chance of reaching the ranks of the top 400 or so party officials, the ones with seats on the Central Committee, the Politburo or its standing committee. Instead of pure talent, political patronage and family connections are the critical factors in ascending to the top, according to recent academic studies and analyses of the backgrounds of the leaders. There are growing doubts, even among party elites, over whether such a system brings out those best equipped to deal with the challenges facing this nation of 1.3 billion people, with its slowing economic growth, environmental degradation and rising social instability. A series of recent scandals and revelations that the families of top officials can hold billions of dollars\u2019 worth of investments have also led to greater scrutiny over the role of patronage. On Friday, at a seminar in Beijng, Li Rui, a retired official who once served as Mao Zedong\u2019s secretary, said he had urged party leaders to embrace big changes to how they appoint and oversee officials, warning that otherwise there would be more damaging scandals like one that led to the fall this year of Bo Xilai, the once-powerful politician who had risen quickly through the party ranks, largely because his father was one of the party\u2019s \u201cEight Immortals.\u201d \u201cOur current model produced the Bo Xilai incident,\u201d he said. Cheng Li, a scholar of Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution, wrote in a paper published in September that the Chinese political system was one of \u201cweak leaders, strong factions,\u201d and that it suffered from \u201cnepotism and patron-client ties in the selection of leaders.\u201d Susan L. Shirk, a professor and former State Department official, said Thursday on China File, a Web publication from the Asia Society, that \u201cpatronage is the coin of the realm in Chinese elite politics.\u201d In the United States and other Western countries, some prominent political families have certainly wielded power through successive generations \u2014 think of the Kennedys or Bushes \u2014 but entrenched dynasties and the influence of elders are becoming particularly noteworthy in China. The increasing prevalence of the so-called princelings, those related by birth or marriage to earlier Communist Party luminaries, is one sure sign that family background plays a decisive role in ascending to power. Four of the new standing committee members, including Xi Jinping, come from the red aristocracy. One of them, Wang Qishan, who seems to prefer blue ties, married into it. \u201cXi Jinping himself didn\u2019t come to power because of outstanding political achievements,\u201d said Pu Zhiqiang, a rights lawyer, who added that he believed the new leadership was \u201cquite mediocre.\u201d Just as important as family connections and demonstrated party loyalty is the ability to cultivate China\u2019s top leaders. Five members of the standing committee are considered allies of Jiang Zemin, the party chief who stepped down in 2002, and the others have ties to his successor and rival, Hu Jintao. At least one, Yu Zhengsheng, is also closely aligned with the family of Deng Xiaoping, the supreme leader who appointed both Mr. Jiang and Mr. Hu. Mr. Jiang was the dominant force shaping the seven-member standing committee this year. Old loyalists were rewarded with seats, beating out several candidates \u2014 Wang Yang and Li Yuanchao among them \u2014 who were considered more talented or more charismatic.

That has raised the question of whether it will need an infusion of cash from taxpayers for the first time in its eight-decade history. \u201cThis is the first time that they\u2019ve totally run out of money,\u201d said Representative Spencer Bachus, Republican of Alabama, said on Thursday. \u201cThey have about $600 million, as I understand, that they\u2019re burning through. And within a month, because of the number of foreclosures, they indicated they will have to come to the American people and ask for money.\u201d But federal housing officials stressed that the shortfall was projected, and that they were adopting measures to avoid tapping taxpayer funds. Shaun Donovan, the secretary of housing and urban development, announced a series of steps to reduce losses and increase revenue at the F.H.A. These measure include bumping up its annual mortgage insurance premiums on new loans by 10 basis points. That will cost borrowers about $13 a month, Mr. Donovan said. The F.H.A. will also sell off about 10,000 delinquent loans each quarter, increase short sales of homes where the loan exceeds the value and amplify its efforts to keep families in their homes, avoiding costly foreclosures. The F.H.A. expects these changes, plus other measures it recently put into effect, to contribute $8 billion to $10 billion to its overall value in fiscal years 2013 and 2014. The agency said the new steps would begin as soon as January. The agency also is asking Congress for new administrative capabilities to better manage its portfolio of loans and cut losses. \u201cWe need help from Congress,\u201d Mr. Donovan said. In a meeting with reporters, Carol J. Galante, F.H.A.\u2019s acting commissioner, said, \u201cIt\u2019s literally impossible to say that we will or won\u2019t need a draw\u201d from the Treasury at this point. \u201cWe\u2019re doing all this to increase the likelihood that we will not.\u201d The F.H.A. insures a portfolio of more than $1 trillion in mortgages. The new actuarial report shows that it expects losses on its portfolio of loans originated between 1992 and 2009, including about $70 billion in expected insurance claims on loans endorsed between 2007 and 2009. The agency anticipates profits on insured loans originated from 2010 on. During those years, some of the worst of the housing downturn, the F.H.A. continued to provide insurance on loans to help stabilize the housing market. \u201cAt some level, the government has already accepted\u201d losses on those loans, Ms. Galante said. \u201cThey\u2019re obligations of the government at this point.\u201d The F.H.A. also said loans where the seller put down money for a buyer\u2019s down payment were a significant drain on its books. Such \u201cseller-funded down payment assistance\u201d loans make up only 4 percent of the F.H.A.\u2019s portfolio but account for 13 percent of its seriously delinquent loans. The F.H.A. said it expected to lose $15 billion on such loans, which it no longer insures. Despite the projected shortfalls, the F.H.A. does not have an immediate need for cash, housing officials stressed. \u201cThis does not mean F.H.A. has insufficient cash to pay insurance claims, a current operating deficit or will need to immediately draw funds from the Treasury,\u201d a statement from the agency said. The determination on whether F.H.A. needs to draw on the Treasury will come next fall, said federal housing officials. In February, the White House will perform its own projections of F.H.A.\u2019s capital needs as part of its budget. Then, the F.H.A. will reassess its books as the fiscal year ends in September, and might request a bailout to shore up its capital ratio. Congress would not need to approve an F.H.A. draw from the Treasury. Last year, the White House budget showed the F.H.A. in the red, but the agency improved its financial situation over the course of the year and did not require taxpayer financing. Politicians in Washington, particularly Republicans, have voiced concerns that the F.H.A. could become a drain on the taxpayer, much like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those mortgage finance giants have not required additional taxpayer financing in recent quarters, as the housing market has stabilized. But they have nevertheless received about $190 billion in federal financing in the last four years. The F.H.A. cites three reasons for its deteriorating financial position this year. First, its actuarial review uses \u201csignificantly lower\u201d house price appreciation estimates than it used last year. Second, low interest rates \u2014 while a boon for the housing market, as they drive refinancing activity and entice new borrowers to buy a house \u2014 have hurt the F.H.A.\u2019s bottom line. More borrowers are paying off their mortgages, reducing revenue for the F.H.A. On top of that, borrowers who are not able to refinance are defaulting at higher rates, requiring higher F.H.A. payouts. Finally, refinements to the forecasting model that the actuaries use led to a higher estimate of losses on defaults and reverse mortgages. More broadly, the agency is still struggling from housing downturn \u2014 and its mission is, in part, to help make homes accessible to the millions of low-income people who might otherwise be shut out of the mortgage market."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/17\/business\/economy\/industrial-production-sags-and-even-germany-is-affected.html","body":"INDUSTRIAL production has been stagnating in many advanced economies around the world and is beginning to damage the German economy, which has been the strongest in the troubled euro zone.Figures reported this week showed that industrial production in the euro zone fell 2.5 percent in September from the previous month, the largest monthly decline since January 2009, during the worst part of the credit crisis. Production in Germany was off 2.1 percent. Although the figures are seasonally adjusted, they can be volatile. But the longer-term trend was poor even before the September figures came in. The accompanying charts show year-to-year changes in industrial production, using three-month moving averages to smooth out some volatility, among advanced economies as a group, in the euro zone and five major countries. The Dutch government compiles industrial production figures from around the world. In August, the total for advanced economies was lower than it had been a year earlier, something that had not happened since 2009, although the three-month average, as shown in the chart, remained a little higher. The September figures for some countries will not be out until the end of this month, but it seems likely they will show a drop as well. \u201cGermany has slowed because weak global demand, particularly for the major machinery that Germany exports, is creating lower demand for Germany\u2019s exports,\u201d wrote Greg Jensen of Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund and advisory firm. He said German companies were accumulating large inventories and their profits were suffering. There are exceptions to the world pattern. Chinese industrial production continues to rise at a rate of more than 9 percent a year. While that is down from last year, it remains good. On Friday, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production in the United States slipped in October by 0.4 percent, the second decline in the last three months, although the Fed said it would have been close to unchanged but for the effects of Hurricane Sandy. The annual growth rate is down to less than 3 percent. But the declines have spread to some developing countries. Brazil\u2019s production is running about 3 percent below that of a year earlier, and Indian production is basically flat compared with a year earlier. It is not clear how much of the weakness in industrial production represents a real weakening of demand and how much reflects inventory issues. During the credit crisis, production fell much more rapidly than final demand, as companies found it hard to get financing and worried that their customers would be unable to pay for what was being shipped. Much of the revival in 2010 reflected pent-up demand, and some of the current slowing may simply show that depleted inventories have been replenished. But the declines also provide an indication of continuing problems, particularly in some of the European countries most in need of a growing economy. Greece\u2019s industrial production was never large to begin with, but it is now lower than at any time since the figures began to be compiled in 1995, and is down about a third from its peak, set back in 2000. Italian production appeared to recover in line with that of other countries in 2010, but has since weakened appreciably. For much of this year, it has been down more than 6 percent from the previous year. Spain\u2019s production has fallen almost as rapidly.

It arrives on Sunday on PBS in the middle of a spate of quickly produced programs about Hurricane Sandy and climate change, as if Mr. Burns knew that this would be just the right moment for a cautionary story about human interference with the environment.The parallels, if you accept them, are striking. An artificial phenomenon \u2014 in this case the rapid uprooting of millions of acres of prairie grass for the cultivation of wheat \u2014 contributes to a series of huge storms that eventually drives out 25 percent of the population of the affected area in the southern Great Plains. There is a qualified happy ending: farming practices change, a decade-long drought ends in the late 1930s, and life returns to normal, the promises of the land boom that led to the crisis long forgotten. Mr. Burns presents the story in his usual manner, as a carefully stitched patchwork of vintage photos and film, historical commentary (one of the experts is the New York Times columnist Timothy Egan) and eyewitness accounts held together by the narration of Peter Coyote, whose aw-shucks tones have graced previous Burns films about Prohibition and the national parks. \u201cThe Dust Bowl\u201d is short by Burns standards, four hours over two nights (Sunday and Monday), but his films can seem too long at any length \u2014 the deliberate pace and unvaried rhythm shade into monotony, and you wish that 18 hours were 12, or 4 hours were 3. That\u2019s true to some extent of \u201cThe Dust Bowl,\u201d even though there\u2019s more than enough material, from land rush to Depression, drought, mass migration and New Deal agricultural policies, to fill the time. But Mr. Burns has two aces up his sleeve in \u201cThe Dust Bowl.\u201d One is the copious supply of photographs and film of the dust storms themselves, awesome and apocalyptic images he can put on screen whenever we need a visual jolt. The other is his cast of living witnesses, white-haired survivors who in the 1930s were children growing up in the Oklahoma panhandle or southern Kansas and Colorado. Their first-person accounts of how they and their parents handled the double catastrophes, physical and financial, of the dust storms and the Depression give the film a human element that\u2019s not always present, or possible, in Mr. Burns\u2019s work. (Attesting to the length of time these documentaries require, an end credit notes that four of the interview subjects have died.) The story of the Dust Bowl is complicated, twisting together ecology, economics and politics, as well as divisions of class and region, and Mr. Burns and his writer, Dayton Duncan, have done as careful and admirable a job as you would expect in laying it out. They also express a point of view \u2014 implicitly in their storytelling, and explicitly in the testimony of the Dust Bowl children \u2014 that the large-scale federal aid and intervention carried out under Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s watch were a practical and moral imperative. That will probably be less controversial now than it would have been a few weeks ago. Mr. Burns may not have envisioned his film as a case study in the government\u2019s response to an ecological crisis, but as they say, no one can predict the weather.

The case shone a light on the Greek authorities\u2019 failure to effectively crack down on widespread tax evasion and fueled a debate over media freedom and personal privacy laws. Now, Mr. Vaxevanis is to be retried in a higher-level misdemeanor court on the same charges, and faces a two-year prison sentence if he is found guilty. The Athens public prosecutor\u2019s office found the judge\u2019s verdict in Mr. Vaxevanis\u2019s case to be \u201clegally mistaken\u201d and wants it re-examined, a court official said, adding that a date for a retrial had yet to be set. \u201cSuch appeals by the prosecutor are not unusual, particularly in cases where personal privacy are concerned,\u201d said Aristides Hatzis, a professor of law at the University of Athens, attributing the two-week delay between the verdict and the appeal to \u201cstandard judicial bureaucracy.\u201d During the trial, the prosecutor, Iraklis Pasalidis, accused Mr. Vaxevanis of \u201cturning the country into a coliseum\u201d by defaming people without determining their guilt. The publisher had countered that the names of bank account holders were not private and that the Lagarde list was \u201cnot a legal issue but a very important social and political one.\u201d In a Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Vaxevanis said, \u201cWhile society demands disclosure, they cover up.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/17\/world\/europe\/for-germany-payments-are-about-responsibility-for-jews-recognition.html","body":"BERLIN \u2014 In a week when demonstrators from Greece to Spain drew parallels between Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s drive for austerity and the brutality of the Nazis, a symbolic act marking the commitment that a postwar, peaceful Germany has made to many of those who survived Hitler\u2019s war machine largely went unnoticed.Germany\u2019s postwar reparations program has become such a matter of fact that many Germans are not even aware that their country, after paying \u20ac70 billion, or $89 billion, in compensation to mostly Jewish victims of Nazi crimes since 1952, still meets regularly to revise and expand the qualifications for victims. The aim is to reach as many of the tens of thousands of elderly survivors whose suffering has gone unrecognized. In prominent places among the government buildings in the heart of a reunified Berlin, Germans have placed new memorials honoring the Jewish, homosexual and Sinti and Roma victims. But the reparations program, which was created when Konrad Adenauer, the first chancellor of West Germany, and Israel signed the Luxembourg Agreement in 1952, receives far less attention. The program marked the first time that West Germany assumed responsibility for compensating Jewish victims of Nazi crimes. Stuart E. Eizenstat, special negotiator for the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, praised it as historically unique at a gathering here to mark its 60th year this week. \u201cHere we started 60 years ago, when the German government was on its knees economically, and yet you made this commitment,\u201d Mr. Eizenstat said Thursday at the event in Berlin. \u201cAnd here we are 60 years later at a time when you are bearing the burdens of Europe and a generation never even born during the war continues to fulfill its obligation.\u201d Over the years, the agreement has been amended and adapted to reflect the geopolitical changes in Europe, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Communist rule across Eastern Europe, and the changing needs of aging Holocaust survivors. Last year, for survivors of ghettos, the amount of time spent there to qualify for compensation was reduced to 12 months from 18 months. As of Nov. 1, the program was opened to survivors living in countries previously under Soviet influence, making an estimated 80,000 more people eligible for one-time payments of \u20ac2,556, or $3,250. Starting next year, eligibility will extend to anyone who can prove that they hid for at least six months from the Nazis. The negotiations between officials from the German Finance Ministry and representatives of the Claims Conference have also evolved over the decades. While stiff silence dominated at the signing of the initial agreement, current negotiators view the other side as partners, bound by a common goal of trying to reach as many survivors, while they still can. Roman Kent, 83, a survivor of Auschwitz and the ghetto in Lodz, Poland, said he had been involved in the talks for so long that he no longer remembered when he started. Having built a new life and a successful business in the United States, where he immigrated in 1946, Mr. Kent initially had no desire to become involved in the compensation discussions or to travel to Germany. \u201cWhen I went to the first time, I felt extremely uncomfortable to be there,\u201d he said his first round of negotiations. At one point during that first discussion, Mr. Kent said, he made clear to the Germans across the table how difficult, how emotional, the process was for him. On Thursday, Mr. Kent opened his speech with a quotation from German poet Heinrich Heine, who converted to Christianity from Judaism, and drew a parallel between that reflected how the process of working with the former enemy toward a common goal has altered his perception. \u201cWe survivors and the Germans of today are together united,\u201d Mr. Kent said. \u201cBoth of us do not want our past to be our children\u2019s future.\u201d Not that the process is always smooth. Although the compensation has been supported throughout the years by German governments on both sides of the political spectrum, they must negotiate within the constraints of a federal budget. An investigation begun in 2010 found that employees of the Claims Conference had been involved in a scheme to use fake identification documents to defraud the fund of more than $42 million, only part of which has been paid back. Julius Berman, the chairman of the Claims Conference, says that despite everything that has been accomplished, there are as many as 50,000 victims of the Nazis who have never received compensation in any form. Mr. Berman also points to thousands of people marked by the trauma of losing their parents, and their childhood, to the Nazis as a group still deserving recognition. \u201cIt has never been about the money,\u201d Mr. Berman said of the compensation program. \u201cIt was always about recognition.\u201d Asked whether, given the millions that Germany is now pledging to help weaker economies in the euro zone, there were thoughts that 60 years of payments to survivors was enough, Werner Gatzer, who leads the negotiations for the Germans, shook his head. \u201cWe will have done enough when no more survivors remain,\u201d Mr. Gatzer said. \u201cAs long as they live, we will uphold our responsibility.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/17\/business\/jpmorgan-and-credit-suisse-to-pay-417-million-in-mortgage-settlement.html","body":"JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse agreed to settlements with the Securities and Exchange Commission totaling $417 million over their packaging and sale of troubled mortgage securities to investors, the agency said Friday. The settlements are the latest major penalties extracted by the agency in a broad-reaching investigation into how Wall Street firms bundled mortgages into complex investments in the run-up to the financial crisis.The S.E.C. has leveled claims against a handful of major banks, including JPMorgan and Credit Suisse, that they painted a deceptively rosy portrait of the securities while some of the underlying loans were already showing signs of delinquency. Robert Khuzami, director of the S.E.C.\u2019s division of enforcement, called mortgage products like those sold by the banks \u201cground zero in the financial crisis\u201d in a statement Friday. The S.E.C. cautioned Wall Street to brace itself for more enforcement actions. While the S.E.C. has brought more than 100 cases related to the financial crisis, the agency has won only piecemeal victories against the banks, and has not yet secured a big victory against any individuals responsible for some of the reckless behavior. In a significant setback for the agency, a federal jury in July acquitted a Citigroup manager the S.E.C. had accused of misleading investors in the sale of a complex security made up of residential mortgages. In a conference call Friday, Mr. Khuzami acknowledged the challenge of bringing cases against individuals related to \u201cstructured\u201d financial products, but noted that \u201cwe are by no means shying away from charging individuals.\u201d JPMorgan and Credit Suisse did not admit or deny guilt. JPMorgan agreed to pay $296.9 million to settle the charges and Credit Suisse\u00a0agreed to pay $120 million. The S.E.C. brought the cases in conjunction with the federal-state mortgage task force, which President Obama created in January to investigate the subprime mortgage morass. In its first major salvo against banks, the group sued JPMorgan last month. That federal lawsuit is still pending. Separately, the federal regulator that oversees the housing finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac filed lawsuits against 17 financial firms last year over nearly $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that imploded after the loans soured. Legal wrangling over Wall Street\u2019s behavior during the housing boom has targeted virtually every step in the process, from making loans to borrowers with tarnished credit to the sale of securities engineered with the subprime loans. As a result of the mortgage-litigation storm, banks have had to set aside billions of dollars to deal with claims from investors and regulators. In 2010, the S.E.C. secured $550 million from Goldman Sachs. In that case, the agency focused on a single mortgage security created in 2007, just as fissures spread through the housing market. Goldman allowed a hedge fund manager, the S.E.C. claimed, to help construct the security, then bet against it, but never alerted investors. The S.E.C.\u2019s investigation into JPMorgan included creating troubled securities itself, as well as misleading investors through its Bear Stearns unit, the troubled investment bank it purchased at the urging of the federal government in 2008. In a December 2006 sale of $1.8 billion of mortgage-backed securities, JPMorgan played down delinquency rates of the mortgages used as collateral in the securities, according to the S.E.C. Despite assurances by JPMorgan that only 0.04 percent of the loans were more than 30 days delinquent, roughly 7 percent of the loans were troubled, the agency said. While the bank reaped $2.7 million as part of the deal, investors didn\u2019t fare as well, losing at least $37 million, according to the S.E.C. The S.E.C. also faulted Bear Stearns for pocketing compensation it received from mortgage lenders for shoddy loans that the firm had purchased to package into mortgage securities. Bear Stearns, the agency claimed, never passed that money on to investors in the securities. As a result, Bear Stearns received $137.8 million, the agency said. Credit Suisse was also accused of keeping roughly $55.7 million in such payments from investors. The Swiss bank was also faulted by the agency for misstating when it would buy back mortgages if homeowners fell behind on their payments, as part of $1.9 billion in securities it underwrote in 2006. In a statement on Friday, JPMorgan said that it was pleased to \u201cput these matters\u201d behind it. Credit Suisse also expressed relief, noting that the bank was \u201ccommitted to the highest standards of integrity and regulatory compliance in all its businesses.\u201d The S.E.C. said it would distribute the money to investors harmed by banks\u2019 practices. Despite the settlement, JPMorgan is still dogged by mortgage-related headaches. The mortgage task force case filed last month by New York\u2019s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, claimed that Bear Stearns sold securities between 2005 and 2007 that caused roughly $22.5 billion in losses for investors. In another mortgage feud, JPMorgan is one of the 17 firms that the Federal Housing Finance Agency claims sold shoddy loans to the government without adequately disclosing the risks. In court filings, JPMorgan has pushed for the lawsuit to be thrown out. Beyond the government actions, JPMorgan and other Wall Street banks face an onslaught of battles with private investors. Dexia, a Belgian-French bank, for example, sued JPMorgan in federal court in Manhattan over $1.6 billion in mortgage-backed securities bought from Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. In a statement Friday, Kenneth Lench, head of the S.E.C. enforcement division\u2019s structured and new products unit, said, \u201cThese actions demonstrate that we intend to hold accountable those who misled investors through poor disclosures in the sale of R.M.B.S. (residential mortgage-backed securities) and other financial products commonly marketed and sold during the financial crisis.\u201d He added: \u201cOur efforts in that regard continue.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/17\/your-money\/taxes\/advisers-caution-against-hasty-decisions-in-advance-of-tax-changes.html","body":"WITH all the ominous talk of tax increases and a \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d if President Obama and Congressional leaders can\u2019t agree on a plan to avert automatic tax increases on Dec. 31, some investors may be tempted to act soon to take advantage of the current tax rates.But financial advisers say that in their rush to do something this year, investors may end up with regrets. \u201cAny time you make a decision purely for tax reasons, it has a way of coming back and biting you,\u201d said Mag Black-Scott, chief executive of Beverly Hills Wealth Management. \u201cCould you be at a 43 percent tax on dividends instead of 15 percent? The straight answer is yes, of course you could. But what if that doesn\u2019t happen? What if they increase just slightly?\u201d Various proposals are on the table, but the taxes the wealthy say they worry most about are an increase in the capital gains rate to 20 percent from 15 percent, which would affect investments like stocks and second homes; an increase in the 15 percent tax on dividends; and a limitation on deductions, which would effectively increase the tax bill. For the truly wealthy, there is also the question of what will happen to estate and gift taxes. In addition, the health care law sets a 3.8 percent Medicare tax on investment income for individuals with more than $200,000 in annual income (and couples with more than $250,000). Taking taxes on capital gains as an example, Ms. Black-Scott, who started her career at Morgan Stanley in the late 1970s, said people needed to remember that the rates were 28 percent when Ronald Reagan was president. \u201cIf they go from 15 to 20 percent, is it really that bad?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou need to say, \u2018Do I like the stock?\u2019 If you do, why would you get rid of it?\u201d Here is a look at some of the top areas where short-term decisions based solely on taxes could end up hindering long-term investment goals. APPRECIATED STOCK Many people have large holdings in a single stock, often the result of working for a company for many years. And the stock may have appreciated significantly over that time. But if they are selling now solely for tax reasons, advisers say they shouldn\u2019t. The stock may continue to do well and more than compensate for increased capital gains. But there is an upside to an increase in the capital gains rate: wealthier clients may finally be pushed to diversify their holdings. \u201cIf you have 75 percent of your wealth in one stock, then it\u2019s a really appropriate time to think about this,\u201d said Timothy R. Lee, managing director of Monument Wealth Management. If the increased tax rate \u201cis a motivating factor for some people, O.K. Letting go of that control and the pride that goes with it is a really difficult decision.\u201d Selling stock now may also make sense when it is in the form of stock options set to expire early next year. \u201cDo you want to take the risk the price will drop in January?\u201d asked Melissa Labant, director of the tax team at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. \u201cWhat if we have a fiscal cliff or a change in the markets? If you\u2019re comfortable, do it now.\u201d Some investors may also fear that higher taxes will drive all stocks down. Patrick S. Boyle, investment strategist at Bessemer Trust, said there was no historical link between tax increases and stock market performance. In the most recent three tax increases, he says, \u201cthe market has actually gone up in the six months before and after.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s not that tax rates aren\u2019t important. They are. It\u2019s just that there are so many other things going on that are more important than tax policy.\u201d MUNICIPAL BONDS Bonds sold to finance state and local government projects are tax-free now and will be tax-free next year. That is no reason to load up on them. Tax-free municipal bonds have always been attractive to people in higher-income tax brackets. Now, advisers fear that individuals just above the $200,000 threshold, people who say they do not feel wealthy but will probably be paying higher taxes on their income and investments, will try to offset that increase by moving more of their investments into municipal bonds. Beth Gamel, a certified public accountant and executive vice president at Pillar Financial Advisers, imagined a case where people in higher tax brackets, thinking they were acting rationally, sold stocks this year to take advantage of the lower capital gains rates and then, to avoid higher taxes next year, put all or some of that money into municipal bonds. Maybe they outsmart the tax man, but they do so at risk to their retirement. \u201cIt will be very difficult for them to reach their long-term goals,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause the yield on muni bonds is lower than stocks over time.\u201d Or as Will Braman, chief investment officer of Ballentine Partners, said of this trade-off: \u201cIt\u2019s not about minimizing the taxes but maximizing the after-tax returns.\u201d He suggested that people use their deductions to reduce what is owed from taxable securities. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/16\/business\/bank-of-america-and-mbia-revisit-the-mortgage-debacle.html","body":"Two villains in the financial crisis \u2014 whose negligence, or worse, caused untold suffering when the property bubble burst \u2014 are fighting it out. They are battling in the courts, and now in the bond market, where lucky owners of one bond issued by a company that may yet go broke are being offered the chance to cash out at par value. Lawyers are cleaning up.The only people who don\u2019t seem to be doing very well are those who are most deserving: the victims of the crisis.The battle being fought on the most fronts is between Bank of America \u2014 the bank that made the critical mistake of acquiring Countrywide Financial, once the country\u2019s largest mortgage lender \u2014 and MBIA, the troubled monoline insurer that now warns it may not be able to keep paying claims on structured finance securities unless the bank pays it billions for the sins of Countrywide. The insurance claims that could well tilt MBIA into bankruptcy are likely to be made by Merrill Lynch, which Bank of America acquired during the financial crisis, not long after it bought Countrywide. Kenneth D. Lewis, the bank\u2019s chief executive then, will go down in history as the Ado Annie of Wall Street, after the character in the musical \u201cOklahoma\u201d who sang, \u201cI always say \u2018Come on, let\u2019s go!\u2019 just when I ought to say nix.\u201d There was a lot of that willingness to proceed while ignoring risks during the credit boom that preceded the crash. Nowhere was it on display more than in the transactions that led to the battles now being waged. Put briefly, Countrywide sold a lot of mortgage loans to securitizations it created, and paid small premiums to MBIA to insure that investors would not lose money. MBIA issued that insurance after doing no work at all to verify that the loans met the stated criteria, instead relying on Countrywide\u2019s assurances and promises it would buy back bad loans. The securities got top ratings from Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s, which also chose to trust rather than verify. MBIA in those days \u2014 the securitizations in dispute covered second-mortgage loans issued between 2004 and 2007 \u2014 was a supremely confident organization. It had grown by selling insurance on municipal bonds, insurance that it was confident would never lead to any claims, or at least not to any significant ones. Other insurers had leapt into its market, and MBIA was fighting for market share in the rapidly growing securitization market. In 2004, the insurer made a fateful decision, to stop doing due diligence on mortgage loans before it issued insurance on securities based on those loans. Countrywide says the evidence shows that MBIA thought premiums were so low that it needed to cut costs; MBIA says that had it taken the time to check, it would have lost the business to competitors. Countrywide, also fighting for market share, was cutting corners, too. A lot of the home loans it made and put into securitizations seem not to have met the required criteria, a fact that would have been obvious with even minimal review efforts. But nobody was checking. After the financial crisis exploded, it became clear that MBIA was in enough trouble that it would never be able to sell any new muni bond policies unless it did something. It came up with a clever idea to split in two. The good \u2014 United States muni bond \u2014 policies would go into one unit. The unit would be well capitalized and have no responsibility for the bad \u2014 the foreign government and structured finance \u2014 policies. MBIA got its regulator, what was then the New York State Insurance Department, to approve the deal before those who owned the structured finance policies found out about that. One suit, in which Bank of America challenged the split, went to trial this year. It has been five months since the trial ended, but no verdict has been announced. Whatever that judge decides, an appeal is likely. Another judge, hearing a suit filed by MBIA claiming that Countrywide committed fraud in unloading bad mortgages into the insured securitizations, may soon decide whether to throw out the suit (as Countrywide wants) or declare MBIA a winner without a trial (as MBIA wants.) Unfortunately for MBIA, the deadline for getting more cash is approaching. It expects to pay out a lot of money on one set of particularly foolish policies \u2014 with Merrill Lynch, now owned by that same Bank of America, as the recipient. It appears that MBIA will not have the cash to pay the claims, although it is not clear how soon that will happen. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com\/economix."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/16\/us\/defining-adequate-in-texas-school-financing.html","body":"During opening statements in the current trial over how Texas finances its public schools, a lawyer for the state expressed what many were already thinking.\u201cThis is like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Shelley Dahlberg. The state district court trial, which began in October and involves about two-thirds of Texas districts, is the sixth time since 1984 that districts have sued the state over the way public schools are financed under the Texas Constitution. The Texas Supreme Court last ruled on the issue in 2005 when it said current financing levels were adequate but left the door open for future challenges \u2014 with the same judge and many of the same lawyers involved. The courts, facing many of the same arguments, will again decide whether the Legislature has met its constitutional obligation to public education. But over the years, a chorus of conservative voices has posed another fix for the school finance problem. Why not just change the state\u2019s duties under the Texas Constitution? \u201cThe Legislature has never really defined in statute what they are trying to accomplish and what they are willing to fund,\u201d said Bill Peacock, the vice president of research for the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative research organization in Austin. John Culberson, a United States Representative, proposed a state constitutional amendment in 1992 as a state legislator, to keep the courts out of school finance and allow lawmakers to define adequate levels of financing under the State Constitution. It is a concept supported by fiscal conservatives, many of whom object to what they view as the use of taxpayer dollars to sue the state for more taxpayer dollars. Such a measure would require a two-thirds vote of the Legislature to make it onto the ballot, and it has struggled to gain traction. State Representative Gary Elkins, Republican of Houston, was the latest lawmaker to offer the amendment last session. His resolution failed to make it out of committee. Opponents view the courts as a needed backstop against legislative decisions made for political rather than sound policy reasons, and they say the amendment would shift the burden of paying for public schools from the state to local taxpayers. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to convince two-thirds of the representatives that their local school districts would be better off, that their local taxpayers would be better off in general because of such an action,\u201d said State Representative Scott Hochberg, the outgoing vice chairman of the House Public Education Committee. \u201cIt has always taken the courts to force the Legislature to do the right thing on this issue.\u201d But as the 2013 legislative session approaches, echoes of the philosophy behind the amendment have cropped up in the state\u2019s defense during the current school finance trial. Ms. Dahlberg said during her opening statement that if there was not enough money to go around, it was because of decisions made on the local, not state, level. She pointed to districts spending money on extras that were not explicitly required by the state. \u201cAsk yourself or the witnesses whether a district can provide for the general diffusion of knowledge without iPads or teacher aides or brand-new facilities,\u201d she told the judge. \u201cThe wish lists of superintendents are not sufficient evidence that the Legislature has acted arbitrarily.\u201d msmith@texastribune.org"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/16\/business\/fha-short-billions-may-need-rescue-by-taxpayers.html","body":"WASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Housing Administration, a government agency that insures mortgages, is on the verge of requiring taxpayer financing for the first time in its eight-decade history. An independent audit to be released on Friday projects that the administration will not have the cash reserves to pay all of its obligations, with the total shortfall amounting to about $16.3 billion. \u201cThis does not mean F.H.A. has insufficient cash to pay insurance claims, a current operating deficit or will need to immediately draw funds from the Treasury,\u201d the report stressed. But it does make a taxpayer bailout likely. Reserves at the administration, which insures more than $1 trillion in mortgages, fell to below $3 billion last year. And the report cites a number of weaknesses on the agency\u2019s books. \u201cWe will continue to take aggressive steps to protect F.H.A.\u2019s financial health while ensuring that F.H.A. continues to perform its historic role of providing access to homeownership for underserved communities and supporting the housing market during tough economic times,\u201d said Carol J. Galante, its acting commissioner, in a statement. The F.H.A. \u201chas weathered the storm of the recent economic and housing crisis by taking the most aggressive and sweeping actions in its history to reform risk management, credit policy, lender enforcement and consumer protections,\u201d Shaun Donovan, the secretary of housing and urban development, said in a statement. Politicians in Washington, particularly Republicans, have voiced concerns that the agency could become a drain on the taxpayer, much like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those two mortgage finance giants have not required additional taxpayer funding in recent quarters, as the housing market has stabilized. But they have nevertheless received about $190 billion in federal financing in the last four years. An agency release cites three reasons for its deteriorating financial position. Home prices have not risen as quickly as the administration\u2019s actuaries expected. Low interest rates have weakened its books. The agency\u2019s independent actuary used a \u201crefined methodology this year to more precisely predict\u201d its losses. More broadly, the agency is still struggling from the burst of the real estate bubble. By many measures, housing prices have only recently started to stabilize and increase. The rate of foreclosures remains high. The agency\u2019s books are improving, a release said. But it noted that its portfolio of loans insured between 2007 and 2009 \u2014 after the housing bubble started to collapse \u2014 were placing a \u201csignificant\u201d strain on its finances. The independent actuaries project more than $70 billion in losses on those loans."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/16\/world\/europe\/greeks-pelt-german-diplomat-in-austerity-protest.html","body":"PARIS \u2014 Demonstrators surrounded a German diplomat in Salonika in northern Greece on Thursday and hurled coffee and bottles of water at him, another reflection of growing anger in Greece against what is widely seen as a crippling austerity plan being imposed largely by Germany.The incident involving the diplomat, Wolfgang Hoelscher-Obermaier, flared a day after Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s special envoy to Greece, Hans-Joachim Fuchtel, said studies showed that 1,000 German local government officials could do the work of 3,000 Greek officials. His remarks, which came as European leaders dallied again over how to finance the debt-racked country, infuriated Greeks in Salonika who had been on strike and had occupied the town hall to protest a $17 billion austerity bill that Prime Minister Antonis Samaras\u2019s government approved last week. Greece had to pass the measure in order to receive $40 billion in aid that it needs to avoid bankruptcy. On Thursday, Mr. Fuchtel said his comments were not directed at Greek officials. \u201cI have met many industrious Greek civil servants,\u201d he said. \u201cMy point was about making the administration more effective, with fewer levels of decision making.\u201d But in a country with unemployment nearing 30 percent, and where the austerity measures passed last week were equivalent to 9 percent of the country\u2019s economic output, Mr. Fuchtel\u2019s comments were seen as tone deaf. Early reports that protesters had stormed a meeting in Salonika that included the diplomat, Mr. Hoelscher-Obermaier, were incorrect, Mr. Fuchtel said, adding that the only disruption came when coffee was thrown on Mr. Hoelscher-Obermaier. But Greeks were still riled by Mr. Fuchtel\u2019s remarks. He \u201ccannot understand exactly how serious is the problem, the social deterioration in Greece,\u201d said Nikos Xydakis, a columnist for Kathimerini, a daily newspaper. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he understands how the unemployment rates are translated in human lives,\u201d he said, adding that Mr. Fuchtel lacked \u201cthe flexibility and the diplomatic skills\u201d to speak more carefully. The Greek-German tensions broke open a day after coordinated strikes in Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece. That effort, and the deep divisions among Greece\u2019s foreign lenders over how best to resolve the country\u2019s debt problems, have tapped into a growing sense across Southern Europe that the social order is unraveling faster than European leaders are acting to preserve it. Mr. Fuchtel\u2019s task was to assist Greek municipalities in setting up strategic partnerships with German towns and cities to help them become more efficient. He has been received warmly by officials but less so by a wary public. European officials this week delayed a decision on releasing the $40 billion aid installment, saying they needed more time to assess if Greece was adhering to reforms promised in exchange for two bailout packages totaling more than $300 billion. Greece\u2019s European partners are likely to send billions in aid anyway by the end of November to avoid the threat of a default and the trouble it could stir up, both in bond markets and on Greece\u2019s streets. Meanwhile, Germany\u2019s economy continued to defy the recession that is gripping the euro zone, growing 0.2 percent in the third quarter even as the Greek economy continued to collapse. That growth is drawing thousands of migrants. According to statistics released Thursday, half a million people moved to Germany in just the first six months of 2012, with an especially sharp rise in the number of people moving there from crisis-stricken countries in Southern Europe. An additional 6,900 people came from Greece, an increase of 78 percent over the first half of 2011, along with an additional 3,900 from Spain, a 53 percent increase, and 2,000 more from Portugal, also a 53 percent increase. The absolute numbers are not that large, but the increase in migration to Germany\u2019s relatively robust economy could stoke fears of a brain drain in the euro zone. German companies have been trying to recruit for professions from engineering to health care as more people leave the country\u2019s rapidly aging work force.

The downturn was slightly less severe than in the second quarter, when growth contracted 0.2 percent. But it was the fourth consecutive quarter of no growth or a decline. Perhaps more worrisome, the data showed that Spain, Portugal and several other countries remained far from the kind of recovery that would bring increased tax revenue and help them overcome their debt problems. European leaders, who have benefited from a tenuous calm on financial markets in recent months, are likely to face additional pressure to ease the government austerity programs that have undercut growth in Southern Europe. Economists at Nomura warned of \u201ca depressionary environment in a growing share of the region.\u201d In a note to clients, they said, \u201cThis negative loop has the potential to threaten the stability of the whole system.\u201d Some analysts had forecast a bigger decrease in output. But France registered a surprise uptick in growth and the Italian economy shrank less than expected, moderating the pace of decline across the region. Considered along with sagging factory output and business sentiment, though, the numbers Thursday reinforced expectations that the euro area as a whole could remain in recession well into next year. \u201cAn end to the recession in the euro zone is still out of sight,\u201d Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said in a note to clients. Germany, which has the largest economy in the euro zone, continued to defy the crisis. Its economy grew 0.2 percent in the third quarter, slowing from a rate of 0.3 percent in the second quarter. But data on exports, domestic demand and business sentiment indicated that growth in Germany would slow in future quarters because of falling demand from its neighbors. A recession is often defined as two consecutive quarters of falling output, though many economists say it is important to take other data into account. But with unemployment in the euro area at 11.6 percent and nearly 26 million people out of work, few dispute that the region is in a deep downturn. \u201cLeading indicators suggest that the euro zone recession will broaden and deepen in the current fourth quarter,\u201d said Martin van Vliet, an economist at ING Bank. The European Union, which includes 17 countries in the euro zone and 10 others primarily in Eastern Europe, managed to return to growth in the quarter as several countries, including Latvia and Lithuania, recovered strongly. Growth for the bloc as a whole was 0.1 percent compared with the previous quarter, after a decline of 0.2 percent in the second quarter. But in Western Europe the economic decline spread to Austria and the Netherlands, which had been growing in previous quarters. The Austrian economy contracted 0.1 percent, while the previously healthy Dutch economy plunged 1.1 percent, catching economists off guard. One reason for the decline was that Dutch consumers cut back on purchases of cars, illustrating how the crisis in the European auto industry is having a broader effect. Slower export growth and a decline in construction also had an effect, according to Statistics Netherlands, the official data provider. France grew more than analysts forecast, at 0.2 percent, because of increased exports and higher consumer spending. The Italian economy shrank 0.2 percent, which was less than expected and a less severe decline than in previous quarters. Foreign demand compensated for a decline in household spending in Italy, economists said. There had been some signs in recent months that the euro zone, now in its third year of crisis, was beginning to stabilize. The exodus of money from Spain had stopped and borrowing costs for Spain and Italy have dropped out of the danger zone, thanks to a promise by the European Central Bank to intervene in bond markets. Exports from some of the troubled countries have risen, as companies put more emphasis on foreign markets to offset poor demand at home. Mario Draghi, the central bank\u2019s president, said last week that although growth would continue to slow through the end of this year, he expected a slow recovery next year. The data Thursday could raise expectations that the bank will cut its benchmark interest rate, already at a record low of 0.75 percent, when its policy makers meet next month. But the central bank has already stretched its mandate to fight the crisis, and the burden may now fall primarily on government leaders. Germany could face added pressure to ease its insistence on drastic budget cuts by Spain, Greece, Italy and Portugal, especially after large protests in those countries this week. Euro zone finance ministers are expected to meet next week to consider whether to release the next installment of aid for Greece, which it needs to avoid defaulting on its debt. Next month, European heads of government will hold a summit meeting to continue working on ways to make the common currency area more resilient, for example by pooling supervision of banks. \u201cIt is essential that the period of relative calm on financial markets is preserved,\u201d said Marie Diron, an economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young. \u201cThis will necessitate further quick progress on key reforms, including securing Greece\u2019s financing and moving towards a comprehensive banking union.\u201d But disputes remain on the future shape of the euro zone, and there is a risk that leaders will not move fast enough. Economists said that much of the slowdown in business activity reflected uncertainty among managers, who do not want to invest until they are more confident of a recovery. \u201cThe confidence shock will therefore continue to hinder investment and hiring decisions,\u201d Mathilde Lemoine, an economist at HSBC, said in a note."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/11\/15\/business\/smallbusiness\/samuel-adams-brewer-counsels-small-businesses.html","body":"Carlene O\u2019Garro\u2019s cake business was barely a month old when she arrived at the Samuel Adams brewery in South Boston recently to meet with business counselors, but she brought with her an agenda that hinted at outsize ambitions.Ms. O\u2019Garro bakes nondairy cheesecakes that she was selling at a handful of grocery stores, including two Whole Foods outlets, in the Boston area. She hoped to learn how to expand the business and distribute the cakes nationally. \u201cI know Jim is all over the place,\u201d she said, \u201cand I want to be like that.\u201d Jim is Jim Koch, the founder of the Boston Beer Company and one of 36 advisers who spent an evening last August \u201cspeed coaching\u201d fledgling food, beverage and hospitality businesses. In 20-minute sessions, some 95 bakers, brewers and restaurant owners peppered the coaches \u2014 Boston Beer employees and consultants who included lawyers, accountants and small-business counselors \u2014 with questions about both basic day-to-day issues and more strategic concerns. Speed coaching is one element of \u201cBrewing the American Dream,\u201d a program Boston Beer established with a microlender, Accion, to help small businesses. Mr. Koch, who started brewing Samuel Adams Boston Lager at his house in 1984, remains central to these efforts even as he presides over a company with a market capitalization of $1.4 billion and annual revenue of more than $500 million. He said he had not forgotten his early days, when he struggled to find capital, get his beer into distribution networks and expand. In six sessions that August evening, Mr. Koch spoke with perhaps a dozen entrepreneurs and then stayed another hour to visit with six or eight more. This year, Boston Beer and Accion are staging 12 speed-coaching events in 11 cities, and Mr. Koch expects to attend about half of them. Big businesses reaching out to help smaller businesses has come into vogue since the recession. In 2009, Goldman Sachs introduced its 10,000 Small Businesses campaign. Starbucks raises money from customer donations to finance small-business loans. American Express encourages consumers to shop locally on \u201cSmall Business Saturday\u201d after Thanksgiving. The New York Stock Exchange links small vendors with large corporations and finances loans through Accion. And several corporations have run contests \u2014 Wal-Mart, Chase Bank and Staples have furnished winning small companies with opportunities for retail distribution, capital and office equipment. It is the latest example of what is known in corporate circles as cause marketing \u2014 hitching a brand to a social issue. \u201cHow you improve the American economy and create jobs is on everybody\u2019s minds these days,\u201d said David Hessekiel, founder and president of Cause Marketing Forum. \u201cCompanies know that it\u2019s on the minds of their consumers, and they want to be seen as part of the solution, not as the enemy.\u201d That has been a particular concern for chains like Wal-Mart and Starbucks, given their longstanding reputations for forcing local competitors to close. Helping small businesses, Mr. Hessekiel said, \u201chelps them deal with an old issue.\u201d But some critics of the big chains dismiss their chivalry as mostly cosmetic. \u201cThe public relations value of being associated with small business is quite high,\u201d said Stacy Mitchell, a senior researcher at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit based in Minneapolis and Washington that promotes strong local economies. \u201cYou\u2019ve got companies that have very aggressive expansion strategies \u2014 they\u2019re really squeezing out opportunities for small businesses. These programs do very little compared to the larger shifts in market share that these companies are driving. They\u2019re drops in the bucket.\u201d For its part, the Boston Beer program actually predates the recent economic crisis. The seeds of the idea, Mr. Koch said, came to him in 2007 as he walked to his car after he and his employees had volunteered to paint a nearby community center. \u201cI should have felt really good, and I didn\u2019t \u2014 I felt a little depressed,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I realized is, I\u2019d just taken about $10,000 worth of management time and talent, and turned it into about $1,000 worth of painting. And it was pretty bad painting, too.\u201d Mr. Koch retooled his company\u2019s philanthropy to take advantage of its resources, particularly its employees\u2019 expertise. The company has committed $1.4 million to finance loans, which are handled by Accion. The loans are small, typically $5,000 to $7,000, with terms of 18 months to two years and interest rates that vary regionally. (In New England, the rate is around 13 percent, typical for microloans.) Perhaps as important as the money is the tutoring by Mr. Koch and his employees. Most microloan programs provide borrowers with rudimentary counseling, but Boston Beer is unusually \u201chigh touch,\u201d said Shaolee Sen, vice president for strategy and development at the Accion U.S. Network. Ms. O\u2019Garro was one of the program\u2019s original clients \u2014 she has had two loans, totaling $4,000 \u2014 and though she\u2019s repaid that debt and though the muffin business it helped finance has been dormant since 2010, she continues to derive benefits from the program with her cheesecake business, Delectable Desires. She learned how to price her cakes from an employee in Boston Beer\u2019s finance department, Mike Cramer, who went to Whole Foods and scoped out the competition. \u201cHe actually made a spreadsheet for me of how much the high-end and low-end desserts cost,\u201d she said. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"}]
