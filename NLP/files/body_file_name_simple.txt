[{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/euro-avoids-collapse-but-its-future-remains-uncertain.html","body":"Remember the euro crisis?Only a few months ago, it was front-page news. Would the euro collapse? Would most of southern Europe go broke, unable to borrow money at any reasonable rate? Would that bring on a new world recession? But in this week\u2019s foreign policy debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney, the euro never came up. Europe was mentioned once, but the reference had nothing to do with economics. Mr. Romney did refer to Greece, but only to say we were in danger of going down the same path if we did not change our ways. To a surprising extent, the perception seems to be that the European situation is under control. That is true if all you worry about is whether bondholders will get paid. It is false if you have a broader perspective. The focus of the last couple of years on borrowing costs for peripheral members of the euro zone was, in retrospect, unfortunate. It was always clear that Europe, as a whole, had the ability to solve that issue if it wished to do so. The European Central Bank, like the United States Federal Reserve, has the ability to print money, and that is what it finally did. But the real issue was \u2014 and remains \u2014 whether the peripheral countries could turn into successful economies while staying in the euro zone. On that issue, progress is painfully slow. \u201cThe actions of the E.C.B. and other policy makers in Europe have generally had the effect of filling large financial gaps in periphery bank and sovereign funding,\u201d wrote Bob Prince of Bridgewater Associates this week, \u201cbut have done relatively little to resolve competitive imbalances among these economies.\u201d Banks are hesitant to lend. On Thursday, the European Central Bank report on loan activity in September showed a record 1.4 percent year-over-year decline in loans outstanding to private sector companies and individuals in the euro zone. \u201cThese numbers are rather consistent with the bleak picture painted by business surveys, showing an ongoing contraction of activity,\u201d wrote Fran\u00e7ois Cabau and Phillippe Gudin of Barclays Capital in a note to clients. If peripheral countries simply had fixed exchange rates, rather than a common currency, they could and almost certainly would have devalued their currencies long before now. That is the normal prescription for countries in financial distress. Couple it with austerity and revivals can be surprisingly rapid, as exports surge and imports plunge. As it is, the process is sure to be long and painful, but not certain to succeed. As Europe stumbles and slows, there has been a temptation in the United States to turn our attention elsewhere, to Asia for economic reasons and to the Mideast for political ones. Mr. Romney has tried to add South America to that mix. But neither the Romney nor Obama campaign has wanted to talk much about Europe, a fact that has been noted with a little alarm in Europe. Richard Lambert, the chancellor of Britain\u2019s Warwick University \u2014 and a former editor of The Financial Times as well as a former central banker \u2014 was in New York this week trying to convince Americans that they should care, and predicting that the euro will survive. \u201cThe European Union has the capacity to get its affairs into order, if it has the political determination to do so,\u201d he said in a speech at New York University. \u201cThis is a crisis about economic imbalances within the euro zone, more than it is about fault lines with the rest of the world.\u201d That is a point worth remembering. The euro zone as a whole is running smaller budget and current account deficits than is the United States. If it were one country, there might be articles about depressed regions, but not talk of collapse. But it is not one country. It is taking halting steps in that direction, with a move to unified bank supervision, but political union is not going to happen; Angela Merkel\u2019s name is never going to be on a ballot outside of Germany. Nor is there going to be easy labor mobility around Europe, even though that is supposedly guaranteed now. Cultural and language differences assure that. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com\/economix."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/us\/david-dewhurst-gives-lawmakers-and-lobbyists-a-little-extra.html","body":"Ross Ramsey, the executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.Membership really does have its privileges. When Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst sped up the legislative schedule \u2014 naming Senate committee chairmen now instead of waiting until after the session starts in January \u2014 he gave the new leaders a little something extra. Mr. Dewhurst did the same for people with business before the Legislature. Those two camps can get a head start on building their relationships. In three months, you might even be able to put a number on it. In the normal order of things, Texas voters elect their legislators in November during even-numbered years, then those legislators convene in January of every odd-numbered year following the elections for a 20-week regular session. Several weeks into those sessions \u2014 often, in February \u2014 the leaders of the two legislative bodies \u2014 the House speaker and the lieutenant governor \u2014 organize members into the committees that will handle various subjects, like budgets, public schools, prisons and economic development. Mr. Dewhurst, fresh off a stinging and personally expensive loss in the race for the Republican nomination for United States Senate, is getting his political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 back together \u2014 mainly by putting his nose to the grindstone and returning to State Senate business. He will be working in front of a different Senate this time, one with at least six new members, a number of whom are more conservative than the people they are replacing. Among his moves, he put Dan Patrick, Republican of Houston \u2014 an advocate of taxpayer-backed vouchers for private schools \u2014 in charge of the Public Education Committee. He named Tommy Williams, Republican of The Woodlands, to fill the empty chairmanship of the budget-writing Finance Committee. He removed Judith Zaffirini, Democrat of Laredo, from her post as chairwoman of the Higher Education Committee, installing her on the less prestigious Government Organization Committee. The thing to note here is the timing. To keep up appearances and to avoid the impression of any direct pay-for-play governing, lawmakers aren\u2019t allowed to raise money while they\u2019re in regular session, and for the 30 days leading up to a legislative session or during the 20 days that follow one. As a practical matter, that means lawmakers, donors, lobbyists and their various ilk don\u2019t exactly know before the contribution blackout who will be doing what. They often have a fair idea, but without certainty. If, say, somebody has been the head of the Senate State Affairs Committee for a while, like Robert Duncan, Republican of Lubbock, has, there is a good chance he will be in that spot or in an even better one in the future. (In fact, that happened: he will remain in that post.) Experts and reliable allies tend to stay in place. But this is a year of heavy legislative turnover. At least half a dozen senators aren\u2019t coming back, leaving some big positions open. Mr. Dewhurst\u2019s shuffle put almost a dozen senators in chairmanships they did not hold before. He can always fiddle with it later, and he hasn\u2019t announced which senators will populate those committees, but the leadership appears to be set. That blackout on campaign contributions doesn\u2019t happen until December. And only one Senate seat is truly in play in the November elections. Even if they wait until after the elections, the lobby, the interests, the fund-raising and campaign consultants, and the candidates all have time to get together, to build their relationships, to talk about the issues. And to raise money. Not to pick on Ms. Zaffirini, but she provides an easy example of what to expect. Her new committee will oversee \u201csunset bills\u201d that have to pass for various agencies to stay in business. The policy idea is that those agencies won\u2019t survive without continued legislative approval, which is given in 12-year doses. One of the agencies on this year\u2019s list is the Texas Railroad Commission which, in spite of its name, regulates the oil and gas business. That industry is booming right now, with hydraulic fracturing hot spots like the one in the Eagle Ford Shale, a formation that significantly overlaps Ms. Zaffirini\u2019s Senate district. More important, it overlaps the business of the committee she has just been named to lead. What appeared to be a slight from the lieutenant governor could be a boon instead. She\u2019s got a bunch of new friends, and time to build relationships and raise money. rramsey@texastribune.org"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/us\/politics\/obama-and-romney-raise-1-billion-each.html","body":"President Obama and Mitt Romney are both on pace to raise more than $1 billion with their parties by Election Day, according to financial disclosures filed by the campaigns on Thursday.From the beginning of 2011 through Oct. 17, Mr. Obama and the Democrats raised about $1.06 billion, and Mr. Romney and the Republicans collected $954 million, including some money for the party\u2019s Congressional efforts, setting up 2012 to be the most expensive presidential campaign in history. But the sources of that money, raised over the course of a deeply polarizing campaign, echo the sharp divisions between the two men and their parties over issues like abortion rights, the role of government in regulating industry and the country\u2019s economic future. Wall Street has invested more heavily in Mr. Romney, a former financier who has pledged to repeal Mr. Obama\u2019s new financial regulations, than in any presidential candidate in memory. Employees of financial firms had given more than $18 million dollars to Mr. Romney\u2019s campaign through the end of September and tens of millions more to the \u201csuper PACs\u201d supporting him. Insurance companies, doctors and law, accounting and real estate firms are giving less to Mr. Obama and the Democratic National Committee than they did four years ago, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Yet donors in other industries have stepped in. With Mr. Obama making repeated trips to Silicon Valley and holding round tables with executives there, the technology industry has donated about $14 million to the president and the Democrats, substantially more than in 2008. Retirees, the biggest single source of money for both sides, have given the Democrats much more than they did four years ago, as have employees of women\u2019s groups, retailers and hospitals and nursing homes. To make up for the loss of business money that flowed to his campaign four years ago, Mr. Obama has also turned to the very smallest donors, building an army of millions of supporters who have given as little as a few dollars each. About 4.2 million people sent donations to Mr. Obama and the D.N.C., his campaign said on Thursday, roughly one million more than in 2008. Over all, 55 percent of the Obama campaign\u2019s money through the end of September came in donations of less than $200, including from many people who have repeatedly sent in small checks over the course of the campaign. Just 13 percent of his checks were for $2,500, the maximum that donors are allowed to contribute for either the primary or general election. Mr. Romney, by contrast, has cultivated business leaders and benefited from a Republican donor establishment that is eager to defeat Mr. Obama, raising an unprecedented amount of money from wealthy donors who gave the maximum allowed. Just 22 percent of his cash has come from donations of less than $200. Through the end of September, 45 percent of checks to Mr. Romney\u2019s campaign were for the maximum $2,500 contribution. Neither candidate is likely to raise as much money directly for his own presidential committee as Mr. Obama did in 2008. A flood of online donations that year, and support from many traditionally Republican donors, helped Mr. Obama raise $748 million for his presidential committee. The D.N.C. raised another $244 million, bringing the combined total to a little under $1 billion. This time around, Mr. Obama, as an incumbent, has raised more of his total through the D.N.C., which can accept five-figure checks from each of Mr. Obama\u2019s wealthiest supporters. By raising more money from his very biggest and very smallest donors, Mr. Obama has been able to offset his losses from the business world and from previous contributors who gave less or not at all this time, whether because of the recession or fading enthusiasm. Mr. Romney, after becoming the presumptive Republican nominee in the spring, almost immediately began a fund-raising effort with the Republican National Committee, several state parties and the two Congressional campaign committees. Mr. Romney\u2019s total through September included about $13.6 million that was raised for and transferred to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee. The overall totals do not include hundreds of millions of dollars being raised and spent by \u201csuper PACs\u201d and other outside groups, mostly to benefit Mr. Romney and other Republicans. Groups aligned with Mr. Romney have spent $302 million on campaign advertising that they are required to disclose to the F.E.C., compared with about $120 million for groups aligned with Mr. Obama. Tens of millions of dollars more has been spent on issue advertisements whose precise costs are difficult to measure. \u201cAs the Romney campaign and their \u2018super PAC\u2019 allies continue to outspend us on the air, we\u2019re making every effort to expand our donor base heading into the final stretch,\u201d said Adam Fetcher, an Obama spokesman. Mr. Romney and the Republicans raised about $21.3 million more than Mr. Obama and the Democrats during the first 17 days of October, according to the disclosures filed on Thursday, as Mr. Romney rose in the polls and performed well in debates, emboldening his supporters. Mr. Obama and the Democratic National Committee took in $92.4 million during that period, after surpassing Mr. Romney in August and September. Mr. Romney and the R.N.C. raised $113.7 million over the same period, the final days for which the campaigns are required to report their fund-raising before the election on Nov. 6. Mr. Romney and his party also spent about $146.2 million during the first 17 days in October, slightly less than the $149.7 million spent by Mr. Obama and the Democrats. While Mr. Obama\u2019s team invested tens of millions of dollars early in the campaign to identify, contact and raise money from grass-roots voters, those expenditures have left the Republicans with more cash in the final weeks of the election that could finance a late surge of advertising. Mr. Romney and the G.O.P. ended the final filing period with $169 million in cash on hand, significantly more than the $123.8 million held by Mr. Obama and the Democrats.

He then stayed on the run for more than a dozen years until he was finally killed in 2011 in a shootout at a security checkpoint in Somalia.He was Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, a Qaeda leader in East Africa and, it turns out, the author of an autobiography that is now playing a role in a terrorism case in Federal District Court in Manhattan. \u201cThe main principle of our work in Kenya was to remain covert,\u201d Mr. Mohammed wrote in one excerpt quoted in court papers. In another passage, he said, \u201cI worked hard on the new Kenyan and Tanzanian brothers to raise their morale and to clarify the fundamentals of jihad in their minds.\u201d In yet another section, Mr. Mohammed told how he stayed alive, given his clandestine mission, by moving to a house whose location was not known to anyone, including to fellow operatives. \u201cSeverance of all associations with previous places and colleagues is my successful way to survive in my line of work,\u201d he wrote. The original Arabic version of the autobiography was posted on a jihadi Web site for a time in 2009, said Nelly Lahoud, a senior associate at the Combating Terrorism Center at the United States Military Academy at West Point, whose study about the document was published by the center in June. \u201cIt is a unique find,\u201d she said Thursday. \u201cThis is the richest internal source we have of Al Qaeda\u2019s inner workings and political culture.\u201d Excerpts from an English translation, which is said to run 220 pages, were filed on Wednesday evening in federal court by lawyers for another Qaeda figure, Wadih El-Hage, a naturalized American citizen from Lebanon who had worked as a close aide to Osama bin Laden. Mr. El-Hage, who was convicted in 2001 in Manhattan of terrorism conspiracy, was depicted by prosecutors as a dangerous operative, privy to Bin Laden\u2019s secrets and adept at carrying his messages. But many of the excerpts cited by his lawyers show Mr. Mohammed complaining, almost whining at times, about Mr. El-Hage, who was once his boss in Nairobi, where the East Africa Qaeda cell was based. By Mr. Mohammed\u2019s account, Mr. El-Hage appeared more interested in making money buying and selling precious stones, even at the risk of revealing the cell\u2019s mission. \u201cI advised Wadih to stop the trading because it will expose our real activities,\u201d Mr. Mohammed wrote. \u201cBut Wadih used to say that the brothers do not support us with our daily life expenses, and he needed to trade in order to make a living.\u201d Mr. El-Hage\u2019s lawyers, Joshua L. Dratel and Sam A. Schmidt, make it clear that they want to use the writings by Mr. Mohammed, who also was known as Haroun, to show that Mr. El-Hage was not as culpable in the conspiracy as the government contended and should be granted some leniency when he is resentenced. (Mr. El-Hage\u2019s conviction was upheld on appeal but his life sentence was vacated.) But prosecutors sharply disagree with these arguments, according to a letter to Judge Lewis A. Kaplan that is part of the filing. In the letter, two prosecutors contend that \u201cthe Haroun autobiography thoroughly inculpates\u201d Mr. El-Hage. They cite passages in which Mr. Mohammed described Mr. El-Hage traveling to Sudan to meet with Bin Laden and his being \u201cin charge of finance\/administration\u201d of the terrorist cell."},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/transcript-of-1944-bretton-woods-meeting-found-at-treasury.html","body":"WASHINGTON \u2014 A Treasury economist rummaging in the department\u2019s library has stumbled on a historical treasure hiding in plain sight: a transcript of the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 that cast the foundations of the modern international monetary system.Historians had never known that a transcript existed for the event held in the heat of World War II, when delegates from 44 allied nations fighting Hitler gathered in the mountains of New Hampshire to create the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But there were three copies in archives and libraries around Washington that had never been made public, until now. \u201cIt\u2019s as if someone handed us Madison\u2019s notes on the debate over the Constitution,\u201d said Eric Rauchway, a historian the University of California, Davis. Economic historians who have viewed the transcript say it adds color and detail to the historical record, an already thick one given the many contemporaneous and subsequent accounts of Bretton Woods. The transcript seems to contain no great surprises, but it sheds light on the intense debates as the war raged abroad. It depicts John Maynard Keynes, the British economist, hurrying to marshal support for the broad agreements on international finance. It underscores the tremendous power then wielded by Britain and, especially, the United States. It also shows the seeds of contemporary disputes being sown. For instance, seven decades ago, a number of poorer or smaller countries were protesting their International Monetary Fund quotas, which determine power in the fund. Many of those countries, including China and India, are still pushing for more influence today. In one section of the transcript, an American representative lays out a proposal for apportioning power in the fund and underscores what was at stake, with the war coming to its bloody climax in Europe. \u201cWe fight together on sodden battlefields. We sail together on the majestic blue. We fly together in the ethereal sky,\u201d said Fred M. Vinson, who later became chief justice of the United States. \u201cThe test of this conference is whether we can walk together, solve our economic problems, down the road to peace as we today march to victory.\u201d But the response was not one of absolute unity. \u201cIn spite of the very eloquent and moving speech of the United States delegate, on behalf of the Iranian delegation I wish to state that the quota proposed for my country is entirely unsatisfactory,\u201d a delegate from Tehran responded. Then, a delegate from China added: \u201cI hesitate greatly to sound a note of discord at this conference. It has been the effort of the Chinese delegation to promote harmony and the success of this great common enterprise. But every delegation has its difficulties.\u201d The Netherlands, Greece, Australia, India, Yugoslavia, New Zealand, France, Ethiopia, Norway and Britain then added their comments and objections. \u201cI think that a lot of people have thought of Bretton Woods as being a stitch-up job between United Kingdom and the United States,\u201d Mr. Rauchway said. \u201cBut that\u2019s overstated, and it\u2019s definitely visible in this transcript. You can see the poorer countries fighting their own corner.\u201d Kurt Schuler a Treasury Department economist, was browsing in an \u201cout of the way\u201d section of uncataloged material in the library two years ago when he came across the Bretton Woods document. He flipped through and saw some remarks by Keynes that he was not familiar with, sort of the economists\u2019 equivalent of a Bob Dylan fan finding unknown lyrics. \u201cI checked them against Keynes\u2019s collected works,\u201d Mr. Schuler said. \u201cAnd I knew I had something.\u201d His research revealed that there were three copies of the transcript that scores of economic historians were not aware of: the version at the Treasury Department; one in the National Archives; and the third in the International Monetary Fund archives. In his spare time, Mr. Schuler set about turning the yellowed transcript into a book, with a co-editor, Andrew Rosenberg. It took a tremendous amount of work, Mr. Schuler said. They read the transcript aloud into transcription software. They added hyperlinks to documents referenced at the conference, and wrote summaries, annotations and historical notes. This week, the polished transcript was published as an 800-page e-book by the Center for Financial Stability, a nonprofit group based in New York that researches financial markets, where Mr. Schuler is a senior fellow and Mr. Rosenberg a research associate. \u201cEveryone thinks they know what happened at Bretton Woods, but what they know has been filtered by generations of historical accounts,\u201d Barry Eichengreen, a professor or economics and political science at the University of California, Berkeley, said in a statement. \u201cInternational monetary history will never be the same.\u201d The transcript provides \u201cinsight in how it was that they were able to maintain a pace of work which allowed them to reach two really big agreements, on the I.M.F. and the World Bank, within a space of three weeks,\u201d Mr. Schuler said. \u201cKeynes was something of a task master,\u201d he added. Benn Steil, a senior fellow and director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, said readers can see the British Empire \u201cdisintegrating before your eyes,\u201d in the transcript. \u201cThe Indians are so vociferous that the British are ripping them off. The British are both furious and mortified that their colony would do this to them,\u201d he said, describing a dispute over debts with the colonies. \u201cBretton Woods was itself 95 percent Kabuki theater,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s interesting Kabuki theater.\u201d"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/10\/26\/business\/global\/citing-lack-of-women-in-top-jobs-european-parliament-rejects-male-nominee.html","body":"BRUSSELS \u2014 Asserting that it was fed up with only men in top jobs, the European Parliament on Thursday narrowly rejected the nomination of Yves Mersch to the executive board of the European Central Bank.The Parliament does not have the power to require that women be considered, and governments still could approve the nomination of Mr. Mersch to a post that has been vacant for months even as the region\u2019s sovereign debt crisis rumbles on. But if they still go ahead with the nomination, governments would pit themselves against the only directly elected body in the European Union over the diplomatically fragile issue of promoting gender balance. They also would be defying a majority of the Parliament during a period of heightened concern about making European institutions like the central bank more democratically accountable. The vote took place at a full session of the Parliament in Strasbourg, France, where 325 members voted against the appointment, 300 voted in favor and 49 abstained. The Parliament must be consulted on nominations to the E.C.B. board, but its \u00a0opinion does not bind governments.\u00a0 In a statement, the Parliament said its members had rejected putting \u201cmen only\u201d at the central bank, and it noted that governments had shown \u201cintransigence in failing to commit to a better gender balance within what is effectively Europe\u2019s most powerful financial institution.\u201d The motivations behind such a high-profile vote were probably more complex. Some members seeking a greater \u00a0role for the Parliament may have seen \u00a0an opportunity to challenge the power \u00a0that governments still exercise over the\u00a0European Union.\u00a0 Other members may have been expressing dislike of some of Mr. Mersch\u2019s \u00a0economic ideas \u2014 in particular a wariness of inflation. \u00a0And some may continue to be \u00a0miffed that a northern European, rather \u00a0than a representative from southern \u00a0Europe, had been selected to replace Jos\u00e9 Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez-P\u00e1ramo of \u00a0Spain, whose term expired on May 31. Mr. Mersch, the head of the central \u00a0bank of Luxembourg, is known for his \u00a0hawkish stance on inflation. He was \u00a0nominated by euro area finance ministers in July. Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, which represents the European Union\u2019s leaders, told the Parliament on Tuesday that Mr. Mersch\u2019s appointment should proceed based on his professional qualifications and experience. Mr. Van Rompuy also said he had asked the union\u2019s member governments to suggest more female candidates in the future. But Mr. Van Rompuy\u2019s appeal did little to sway the opinion of some of the Parliament\u2019s most influential members, including Sharon Bowles, a British member who heads the economic and monetary affairs committee. \u201cMr. Van Rompuy has not taken the opportunity to offer more than lip service to what is a very serious matter,\u201d Ms. Bowles said after the vote on Thursday. \u201cHe has promised nothing, not even a road map, for appointing women to the E.C.B. board in the future.\u201d Ms. Bowles said two years had gone by without an adequate response from governments on the lack of female candidates. A spokesman for Mr. Van Rompuy said that he had no immediate comment on the outcome. A spokesman for the Luxembourg central bank said on Thursday that Mr. Mersch had no comment at this stage. Sven Giegold, a member from Germany and a spokesman on economic and monetary affairs for the Greens group, said after the vote that there had been no women on the board since 2011, when Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell of Austria left the board at the end of an eight-year term. Mr. Giegold noted that there were no female presidents of European central banks. \u201cWith no change anticipated on the E.C.B. board before 2018, this means that women will be excluded from the euro zone\u2019s highest decision-making bodies for the near future,\u201d said Mr. Giegold, who called on Mr. Mersch to withdraw his candidacy. Hannes Swoboda, an Austrian member who is the president of the group of Socialists and Democrats, said in a Facebook chat after the vote that the Parliament could not stop the nomination of Mr. Mersch. But he warned that lawmakers would see it \u201cas a seriously unfriendly act.\u201d This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: October 26, 2012An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a possible motivation for opposition in the European Parliament to Yves Mersch\u2019s nomination at the European Central Bank.

By acting forcefully to address its problems there, Ford is setting a bold example for the rest of the industry, analysts said. Other companies will face pressure to make similar moves or explain to investors why they are continuing to employ too many workers at underused factories. Ford is following the same blueprint to downsize in Europe that it used to turn around its North American business several years ago. The company said Thursday that it expected to lose more than $1.5 billion in Europe this year, up from an earlier estimate of at least $1 billion. Ford said the cuts would save about $500 million in annual costs, and help it return to profitability in the region by mid-decade. Ford\u2019s chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said the automaker was working with its unions in Belgium and Britain to assist workers affected by the factory closings. \u201cWe recognize the impact our actions will have on many employees and their families in Europe, and we will work together with all stakeholders during this necessary transformation of our business,\u201d he said in a conference call with analysts and reporters. Ford had said Wednesday that it would close its assembly plant in Genk, Belgium, by the end of 2014. On Thursday, it said it would also close two plants in Southampton and Dagenham in Britain next year. The actions will reduce production capacity in Europe by 18 percent, or 355,000 vehicles. The company said it would eliminate 4,300 positions in Belgium and 1,400 in Britain. The moves contrast with those of other automakers that have either avoided plant closings altogether, or scheduled shutdowns for several years from now. One industry analyst said other auto companies in Europe could follow Ford\u2019s lead and step up their restructuring efforts. \u201cThere is something to be said for swallowing all of the bad medicine at one time,\u201d said Michael Robinet, managing director of IHS Automotive Consulting in Northville, Mich. \u201cI think other manufacturers have to acknowledge a real sense of urgency now.\u201d European auto sales have fallen to a projected 14 million vehicles this year, down from about 18 million in 2008. Ford\u2019s European chief, Stephen Odell, said the market may drop even further next year, making production adjustments essential for a long-term turnaround on the Continent. \u201cIt\u2019s fairly evident there is surplus capacity across most manufacturers,\u201d Mr. Odell said. \u201cAt some point it has to be addressed.\u201d Renault underscored the gloom, saying Thursday that its third-quarter revenue fell 13.3 percent from a year earlier, to 8.45 billion euros ($11 billion). It warned that \u201cthe continuous deterioration of the European market remains a source of concern.\u201d Several automakers have pledged to reduce capacity in Europe, but actually closing plants has proved difficult. Since 2007, only three European auto plants have been closed: a Saab Automobile plant in Trollhattan, Sweden, which closed after the company collapsed; a General Motors factory in Antwerp, Belgium; and a Fiat plant in Termini, Italy. AlixPartners, a consulting firm, said that Europe was drowning in car factories, with 26 percent overcapacity, equivalent to seven million units in a shrinking market. Only 54 percent of Italian auto manufacturing capacity is being used, Alix estimated, and just 60 percent of French capacity. That contrasts with 89 percent capacity usage in Germany, where most of the region\u2019s strongest carmakers are based, and about 90 percent capacity usage in the United States. G.M. has been negotiating with union leaders to close its large Opel plant in Bochum, Germany, and has said it intends to end production there by 2016. The French automaker PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn had announced plans in July to close a plant in Aulnay-sous-Bois, near Paris, and to lay off 8,000 workers in France. But the company may find it politically challenging to proceed with those cuts after the French government announced on Wednesday that it would provide 7 billion euros in state credit guarantees to Peugeot\u2019s finance unit. 1 2 Next Page \u00bb"}]
